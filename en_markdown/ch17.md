**APPLICATION**

Teachers, coaches, and therapists must make important decisions about the amount of practice people should engage in, as well as how much time to devote to various activities within and across practice sessions within the total amount of practice time available. In terms of the amount of practice needed to learn a skill, the conventional wisdom seems to be that the more practice a person has, the better his or her performance will be in some future situation. Consider some examples. It seems likely that a dance teacher would encourage a dancer who was a bit tentative in certain parts of a routine to spend as much time as possible going over the routine repeatedly in practice. A golf instructor would probably try to help a person be more successful with a certain shot by encouraging the person to spend as much time as possible on the practice range. Our experiences in situations like these lead us to accept the view that for improving performance “more practice is better.” But ironically, although this view of practice seems logical, research indicates that it is not always the best alternative. For example, as you saw in chapter 16 the same amount of practice can yield different learning results when practice follows different practice organization schedules. And, in chapter 15 you saw examples of the same amount of practice resulting in different learning outcomes depending on the frequency of augmented feedback. You will see another example of this type of effect in the Discussion section that follows.

教师、教练和治疗师必须认真思考要总共要安排多少的练习量，以及如何分配练习课课上和练习课之间进行各种活动的时间。在学习一项技能所需的练习量上，传统观点一般认为，一个人练习得越多，他未来在某些情况下的表现就会越好。比如，如果一位舞者对舞步中的某些部分不太熟悉，那他们的舞蹈老师就可能让他们花尽可能多的时间反复练习这个舞步。高尔夫教练如果想提高学员用某一种球杆击球时的表现，那他也可能会鼓励学员尽可能多地在练习场练习。 凡此种种都让我们认为，练习得越多，表现水平提升得也越大。但出人意料的是，尽管这种对于练习的观点似乎合乎逻辑，但研究表明，这并不总是最好的选择。比如在第16章我们了解到，相同的练习量，安排方式不同，产生的学习效果也不同。第15章也举了一些练习量相同但学习效果不同的的例子，在那些例子中学习效果与追加反馈的频率密切相关。在接下来的讨论中，你还会看到更多类似的例子。

After having determined the amount of practice time people need to learn a motor skill, the practitioner needs to determine how much time to devote to various activities within and across practice sessions. 
He or she must determine the amount of time to devote to each activity in a session, the amount of rest between activities within a session, the length of each session, and the amount of time between sessions.

在确定学习一项运动技能所需的总练习时间后，练习组织者需要确定练习课课上和练习课之间进行各种活动的时间，包括一节练习课中分配给每种活动的时间、各个活动之间的休息时间、一节练习课的时长以及每节练习课之间的间隔。

If you are a physical education teacher organizing a volleyball unit, you need to determine how much time you should devote in each class period to working on the various skills, drills, and other activities that you plan to include. If you have determined the total amount of practice time you want to devote to a given activity in the unit, and you know how many class periods you will have in the unit, you will know how much time you need to spend in each class period on that activity.

假如你是一名体育教师，正在组织一个排球教学单元，你需要确定每节课上练习各种技能、操练和执行其他计划包括的活动各自应占多少时间。如果确定了该教学单元中某项活动的总练习时间，并且知道该单元中包含多少个课时，在每个课时中用于特定活动的时间也就确定了。

Similarly, if you are an athletic trainer or a physical or occupational therapist, you need to determine how much time an athlete or a patient will spend on each activity within a session, how much rest time you should allow between activities in a session, when the next session should be, and so on. You also may need to instruct the person concerning how to arrange his or her time schedule to do prescribed activities at home.

同样，假如你是一名运动训练师、物理治疗师或职业治疗师[!! 内地貌似没见过这种职业, 香港倒是有不少, 但是他们不翻译, 直接说PT和OT. "物理治疗师"还能接受,"职业治疗师"就有点莫名其妙了,不知道有没有更好的翻译]，你需要确定在一节练习课或康复课中运动员或病人为每项活动所花费的时间，每项活动之间的休息时间以及下一节课的开始时间等等。你还可能需要指导他们如何安排在家里做指定活动的时间。

**DISCUSSION**

The amount of practice a person devotes to a skill is critical for learning motor skills. This is especially the case when the person has the attaining of expertise as a goal. As we discussed in chapter 12, the impressive work by Ericsson and others has shown that expertise in any field is the result of intense practice for a minimum of ten years (Ericsson et al., 1993). Clearly, for achieving expertise, more practice is better than less. However, the amount of practice required to attain expertise is not our focus here. Instead, we will focus on the amount of practice a person needs to ensure achieving a specific performance goal associated with a specific period of practice.

在一项技能上投入的练习量对于运动技能的学习至关重要，尤其是要把这项技能发展为专长的时候。第12章中提到了 Ericsson 和其他研究人员提出的令人印象深刻的观点，即要在任何领域内取得一技之长都要至少经过十年的认真练习（Ericsson et al., 1993）。为了获得一技之长，自然是练得越多越好，但是获得一技之长需要的练习量并不是本章的重点。本章主要关注在一段特定的练习期中，为了达到特定的表现水平目标所需要的练习量。

There are many situations in which it is important to determine the amount of practice people should experience to achieve specific skill performance goals. Although limitations may exist in many of these situations in terms of the amount of time available for practice, the need to determine the amount of practice required remains. For example, a physical education teacher needs to determine the number of classes within a unit to devote to learning a specific activity. In sports settings, the amount of practice time available is typically restricted by a season’s schedule or by rules established by professional associations. And, in rehabilitation contexts, the amount of time available for therapy is typically restricted by health care provider agencies.

很多情境下都有必要确定为达到预定的表现水平目标，练习者需要投入的练习量。尽管这些情境中可用于练习的时间已经有了许多限制，但需要的练习量还是要规划的。比如，体育老师需要确定在一个教学单元中为某一特定的活动的学习分配的课时数。在体育相关的情境中，可用的练习时间通常会受到赛季时间安排或专业协会制定的规则的限制。而在康复相关的情境中，可用的治疗的时间通常受到医疗服务提供机构的限制。

As we address the issue of optimal amounts of practice, we will limit our discussion to these types of situations and establish some guidelines for the effective and efficient use of available practice time. As suggested by the examples we just considered, this limited focus is particularly relevant to those involved in settings that impose strict practice time limitations on teachers, coaches, and therapists.

所以，本章会限制在上述那些情境中讨论最佳练习量问题，同时会建立一些高效利用可用练习时间的准则。从刚刚举的那些例子可以看出，这种有限的关注对那些在有严格的练习时间限制的教师、教练以及治疗师来说特别有帮助。

**OVERLEARNING AND LEARNING MOTOR SKILLS**

**过度学习与运动技能学习**

Researchers historically have investigated the relationship between the amount of practice and the achievement of specific performance goals within the topic of *overlearning.* **Overlearning** is the continuation of practice beyond the amount needed to achieve a certain performance criterion. A teacher, coach, or therapist implements an overlearning strategy by establishing a specific performance criterion, such as a specific accuracy average for throwing a certain number of balls at a target. The teacher then requires students to achieve that performance criterion during class, record the number of trials it took for the student to reach that goal, and then require a specified number of additional practice trials, to implement an overlearning practice condition.

在历史上，研究人员曾以*过度学习*为课题研究了练习量与达成特定的技能表现目标之间的关系。如果练习量已经超过达到某个表现标准所需要的量，这时再继续练习，就是所谓的**过度学习**。比如在向目标投掷一定量的球的练习中的平均比准确度[!! 有点拗口，但specific accuracy就和比荷(specific charge)一样，直译过来就是比准确度，目前好像也没什么太好的翻译，就先这样，看看需不需要该]就可以是一个表现标准。这些标准通常由教师、教练或治疗师设定，用以实施过度学习。在设定完标准后，教师会要求学生进行练习以达到表现标准，并记录达到这一标准需要的练习次数，然后要求学生进行指定数量的额外练习以满足过度学习的条件。[!! 调了一些，应该没改变原意]

From a theoretical perspective, the assigning of extra practice has merit. According to a motor program–based motor learning theory, extra practice helps strengthen the generalized motor program and response schema for the skill a person is learning, so that the person can call it into action more readily when necessary. From a dynamical systems theory perspective, extra practice is a means by which a learner increases the stability of the coordination and control characteristics in the performance of the skill.

从理论的角度来看，分配额外的练习是有道理的。根据基于运动程序的运动学习理论，额外的练习有助于强化练习者正在学习的技能的概括化运动程序和反应模式，以便其在必要时能够更容易地将学习的技能付诸行动。从动力系统理论的角度来看，额外练习也是一种有效的方法，学习者可以通过这种方法来提高技能表现过程中协调和控制特征的稳定性。

Driskell, Willis, and Copper (1992) reviewed and analyzed fifteen research studies that investigated several hypotheses related to overlearning. The first notable point about this review is that the issue of overlearning has not generated a great deal of research over the years. The fifteen studies covered research articles published from 1929 to 1982. However, these studies involved almost 4,000 subjects, which gives us a good basis for discerning the influence of overlearning on skill acquisition and how various factors influence overlearning. The results of this review indicated that for motor skill learning, overlearning has a positive influence on retention performance. And when extra practice of 50 to 200 percent was analyzed, the higher percentages resulted in relatively proportionate higher retention test performance.

Driskell，Willis 和 Copper（1992）分析回顾了15项调查了与过度学习有关的几个假设的研究。他们这篇综述的第一个值得注意的地方是，多年来，过度学习没有引起大量研究，这15项研究就涵盖了从1929年到1982年发表的研究文章。尽管如此，这些研究涉及近4000名受试者，这为我们区分过度学习对技能习得的影响以及了解各种因素如何影响过度学习提供了良好的基础。这篇综述的结果表明，在运动技能的学习中，过度学习对保留测试的成绩有积极的影响。同时在对50%到200%的额外练习的分析中发现，较高的百分比会相对成比例地提高保留测试的成绩。

Although the Driskell et al. (1992) review provides a comprehensive overview of overlearning as it relates to skill acquisition, it does not evaluate effects related to specific types of motor skills. Because motor learning research has shown that certain types of skills demonstrate some distinct characteristics with regards to overlearning, we will consider three examples in the following sections.

尽管 Driskell 等人（1992）的综述对与技能习得有关的过度学习提供了一个全面的概述，但它并没有评估过度学习对特定类型的运动技能的效果。然而运动学习的有关研究表明，某些类型的技能会在过度学习方面表现出一些明显的特征。因此，我们将在下面的章节中考虑三个例子。

**The Overlearning Strategy for Learning Procedural Skills**

**过度学习策略对学习程序性技能的影响**

*Procedural skills* constitute one type of motor skill particularly well suited to deriving benefits from an overlearning practice strategy. A procedural skill is an interesting combination of cognitive and motor components. Although this term was not included in chapter 1 in the discussion of types of skills, it is a relatively common term used in the training and functional skills literature. It typically requires a person to perform a series of movements that individually are relatively easy to execute. However, to accomplish the total task, the performer must know which movements to make and in what order. These types of skills are especially common in occupational, industrial, and military settings. For example, people perform procedural skills when their jobs require them to put together the components of a circuit board for a computer, or type from a written text.

*程序性技能*是运动技能的一种，过度学习策略对其尤其有效。程序性技能是认知成分和运动成分的有趣结合。虽然这一术语在第一章关于技能类型的讨论中没有被列入，但在有关训练和 functional skill [!!]的文献中是一个相对常用的术语。这种技能通常要求执行者完成一系列的动作：这些动作单独来看都是比较容易执行的，但是为了完成整个技能，执行者必须知道以何种顺序执行哪些动作。这种类型的技能在职场、工业界和军事环境中相当常见。比如组装计算机电路板的部件或打字录入纸本文件都是程序性技能。

A common problem with procedural skills is that people tend to forget what to do to carry out the entire procedure. This is particularly characteristic of procedural skills that they do not perform routinely every day. For example, several years ago, the U.S. Army was interested in improving the performance of soldiers for a procedural skill that involved assembling and disassembling machine guns. This skill was important to study because soldiers typically learned it in a short training period, but did not perform it again until sometime after training; it was not a routine part of their daily duties. The problem was that when they performed a later test on this skill, the soldiers typically showed a large decrement in performance, compared to how they had performed at the end of training. 
To overcome this problem, researchers for the U.S. Army Research Institute (Schendel & Hagman, 1982) proposed that an overlearning training strategy (which they referred to as *overtraining*) would be effective for decreasing the amount the soldiers forgot about the procedure.

关于程序性技能，有一个普遍的问题是，执行者往往会忘记该怎么做才能完成整套程序。这个问题对那些不是每天都例行公事的程序性技能来说尤为显著。例如，几年前，美国陆军开始对提高士兵组装和拆卸机枪的程序性技能上的表现感兴趣。对这项技能的研究十分重要，因为这并不是士兵们的每天的常规任务：他们通常在短期训练中学会了这项技能，但直到训练结束后的某个时候才会再次执行。问题是，当军方后来对这项技能进行测试时，士兵们的表现与训练结束时的表现相比通常会大幅下降。为了解决这个问题，美国陆军研究所的研究人员（Schendel & Hagman, 1982）提出过度学习的训练策略（他们称之为*过度训练*）将有效地减少士兵对该程序的遗忘。

The researchers compared two forms of overtraining to a no-overtraining situation. One form was an “immediate” overtraining condition, which required soldiers to perform 100 percent more trials than they required to achieve a performance criterion of one correct assembly/disassembly trial. The second overtraining condition also involved an additional 100 percent more practice trials, but these trials were administered as “refresher” training midway through the eight-week retention interval used for all subjects. Results showed that both of these overtraining groups performed better than the no-overtraining control group on the retention test, which required the soldiers to practice until they were again able to assemble and disassemble the gun correctly on a trial. However, the two overtraining groups did not differ from each other in the number of trials it took to retrain to the criterion performance of one correct trial.

研究人员比较了两种形式的过度训练和无过度训练的情况。第一种过度训练形式是“立即过度训练”，即在达到一次正确组装/拆卸试验的表现标准后，再进行同样次数（100%）的额外练习。第二种形式也要求进行额外的100%的练习，只是这些练习是在所有受试者的八周保留时间间隔的中途作为“复习过度训练”进行的。之后研究人员进行了保留测试，要求士兵们进行练习，直到他们能够再次在试验中正确地组装和拆卸枪支。结果显示，这两个过度训练组在保留测试中的表现都比没有过度训练的对照组好。然而，两个过度训练组在重新训练到符合表现标准所需的练习次数上并无差异。

Based on the results of this experiment, the authors recommended the immediate overtraining procedure, because it was more cost- and time-effective. Because the trainees were already in the training session, it would take less time and money to have them engage in additional practice there than to bring them back several weeks later for a refresher training session.

基于该实验的结果，考虑到成本效益和时间效益，论文作者建议采用立即过度训练的方法。因为受训者已经去参加了训练课程，让他们在那里进行额外的练习比让他们在几周后回来参加复习训练所花费的时间和金钱更少。

**The Overlearning Strategy for Learning Dynamic Balance Skills**

**过度学习策略对学习动态平衡技能的影响**

In an experiment that involved learning a skill that has less of a cognitive component than the gun assembly/disassembly skill, Melnick (1971) investigated the use of overlearning for a dynamic balance skill. This experiment continues to be the only one reported in the research literature that involves the overlearning of dynamic balance skills. In addition to addressing the question of whether practice beyond the amount the learner needed to achieve a performance criterion was beneficial, Melnick asked whether there was an optimal amount of extra practice. In this experiment, people practiced balancing on a stabilometer until they were able to achieve a performance criterion of being on balance 28 out of 50 sec. After achieving this criterion, each group was required to perform further trials in one of the following amounts: 0 percent (none), 50 percent, 100 percent, or 200 percent of the initial number of trials of practice. Then, all participants performed a retention test twice, one week and then one month after practice.

Melnick（1971）进行了一项实验以研究过度学习策略在动态平衡技能中的使用。在这项实验中，被试者要学习某项技能，且这个技能的认知成分比枪支组装/拆卸技能更少。到目前为止，这个实验是研究文献中唯一一个涉及动态平衡技能的过度学习的实验。除了要解决超出学习者达到成绩标准所需的练习量是否有益的问题，Melnick 进一步还探究是否存在最佳的额外练习量。在这项实验中，被试者要在稳定仪上进行平衡练习，直到能达到在50秒内保持平衡28秒的表现标准。达到这一标准后，还要求每组分别以下列数量进行额外练习：初始练习次数的0%（即不进行额外练习）、50%、100%以及200%。之后所有被试者进行了两次保留测试，一次在练习后一周，一次在练习后一月。

The results showed that all amounts of extra practice were beneficial. This means that all the groups that engaged in extra practice beyond what they needed to achieve the performance criterion performed better on the retention tests. More interesting, however, was the result that there was *a point of diminishing returns* for the amount of retention performance benefit in relation to the amount of extra practice. This effect can be seen in the results when the group that had 50 percent additional practice did as well on the retention tests as the groups that had 100 percent and 200 percent extra practice. So, although additional practice was beneficial, increasing the amount of additional practice beyond the 50 percent amount was not proportionally more beneficial to retention performance.

结果表明，只要进行额外练习，无论数量多少都是有益的。也就是说，所有进行了额外练习的实验组在保留测试中都表现得更好。然而，更有趣的是，额外练习的数量与保留测试的表现之间存在*收益递减点*。从结果中可以看出，进行50%额外练习的小组在保留测试中表现得与进行100%或200%额外练习的小组一样好。因此，尽管额外练习是有益的，但比例超过50%后，保留测试的成绩并不会随着额外练习量的提高而提高。

Supporting evidence for the lack of benefit for additional practice beyond a certain amount was reported by Kwakkel and Wagenaar (2002) for physical therapy sessions. Although this study did not focus on dynamic balance, it showed that providing additional physical therapy sessions each day during a five-day-per-week, twenty-week period did not result in additional benefits for stroke patients immediately after the onset of their stroke.

Kwakkel 和 Wagenaar （2002）也提出了支持上述现象的证据，报告了在物理治疗过程中，超过一定量的额外练习并没有产生帮助。虽然这项研究没有关注动态平衡技能，但这项研究表明，在每周5天、持续20周的疗程里，每天进行额外的物理治疗并不会立即为发生过中风的脑卒中患者[!! stroke patients immediately after the onset of their stroke 不太懂 没发生过中风的人也不能被称为 stroke patient 吧]带来额外的好处。

**The Overlearning Strategy in a Physical Education Class**
**体育课中的过度学习策略**
Researchers also have demonstrated the presence of the “diminishing returns” phenomenon for learning skills in physical education classes. A good example of this is an experiment by Goldberger and Gerney (1990). In a unit of instruction, fifth-grade boys and girls practiced several football skills. The goal of this unit was to help students improve their performance of these skills. To simplify matters, we will look only at the two-step football punt. One group practiced these skills according to a teacher-rotated format, in which the teacher divided the class into five subgroups and assigned each to one of five stations where they practiced a specified skill for 5 min. At the end of every 5 min, students rotated to a new station. Another group of students practiced according to a learner-rotated format: They received index cards describing what they needed to do at each station and then were told to use their 25 min efficiently to practice each skill. Everyone practiced like this for two class periods on two days. The next week, the students performed the skills in a test.
研究人员还证明了在体育课中学习技能也会存在“效益递减”现象。这方面的一个很好的例子是 Goldberger 和 Gerney （1990）的实验。他们的实验让一些五年级的男生和女生在一个旨在帮助学生提高技能表现的教学单元中练习了几种足球技能。为了简化讨论，我们只看两步的足球踢法。其中一组以教师轮换法进行练习。这种方法的步骤是首先设置五个站点，每个站点负责一种特定技能的练习。然后将小组进一步分成五个更小的组，每个组分别到一个站点练习5分钟，练习完后就轮换到下一个站点继续练习。另一组学生以学习者轮换法进行练习：他们会收到一张索引卡，上面记录了每个站点可以练习的技能，然后会被告知要自行有效地分配25分钟来练习每项技能。[!! 把 前半句 "what they needed to do at each station" 改了且加了"自行". 这些改动都是查了原始文献之后为了便于理解而做出的, 书在这里有点不清不楚, 查了之后才知道这两种的方法的差异仅仅在于前者是每个技能固定5分钟, 后者是自由安排, 虽然每种都要练, 但可以自己安排每种技能的时间. 如果不做这些改动, 我觉得读者(至少我)很难单靠一个 efficiently 读出这么多意思. ]所有被试者就这样在两天内练习了两节课。第二周，所有被试者在一次测试中执行了这些技能。

The results showed that the two groups differed in terms of the number of practice trials for this skill, but not in test performance. The teacher-rotated format group actually practiced the skill an average of 7 more trials than the learner-rotated format group. Students in the learner-rotated format group performed from 0 to 67 trials, whereas students in the teacher-rotated group performed from 0 to 87 trials. But there was no difference between the groups in the amount of improvement in their punting performance scores. The additional amount of practice induced by the teacher-rotated format did not yield an additional skill performance improvement benefit on the retention test. Thus, given the time constraints of the unit of instruction, the learner-rotated format was superior, because it provided more efficient use of the available practice time.
结果表明，虽然两组在技能的练习次数上有所不同，但在测试表现上没有差异。教师轮换组实际上比学习者轮换组平均多练习了7次：学习者轮换组的学生进行了0到67次练习，而教师轮换组的学生进行了0到87次练习。但是各组在踢球表现得分的提高程度上没有差异。教师轮换引入的额外练习量并没有在保留测试中带来额外的技能表现提升。因此，考虑到教学单元的时间限制，学习者轮换法更为优越，因为这种方法能更有效地利用可用的练习时间。

**THE OVERLEARNING STRATEGY CAN LEAD TO POOR TEST PERFORMANCE**
**过度学习策略可能会带来较差的测试表现**
Although the overlearning strategy typically benefits skill learning, some evidence shows that in addition to the diminishing returns phenomenon, learning deficits may result from providing *too many* extra practice trials. For example, Shea and Kohl (1990) reported an experiment in which participants learned to push a handle with a specified amount of force (175N). One group practiced this skill for 85 trials. Another group also practiced this skill for 85 trials, but in addition practiced the same skill at four other force goals (125N, 150N, 200N, and 225N) for 51 trials each, for a total of 289 practice trials. A third group practiced the skill with the 175N goal force for 289 trials. One day later, all participants engaged in a retention test in which they performed the skill with the goal force of 175N for 10 trials.
尽管过度学习策略通常有利于技能学习，但一些证据表明，除了效益递减现象，*过多*的额外练习还有可能造成学习效果的下降。例如，Shea 和 Kohl（1990）报告了一项实验结果，在该实验中，被试者要学习用特定大小的力（175N）推动手柄。其中一组被试者对这项技能进行了85次练习。另一组被试者也对这项技能进行了85次练习，但除此之外，他们还练习了125N、150N、200N和225N的力推动手柄，每种大小练习51次，总共练习了289次。第三组以175N作为目标进行了289次练习。所有参与者在一天后都进行了一项保留测试，测试一共包含10次尝试，每次尝试都以175N作为目标。

The results showed that the group that practiced the 175N goal force for 289 trials had the poorest performance on the initial 5 trials of the retention test. In contrast, the group that practiced the variable goals performed best. Results for the group that practiced only 85 trials of the 175N goal fell between those of the two other groups. The differences between these groups were most distinct on the first retention trial. However, on the final 5 trials of the retention test, all three groups performed similarly. These results were replicated in another experiment by the same authors (Shea & Kohl, 1991).
结果显示，以175N作为目标进行了289次练习的组在最初的5次保留测试中表现得最差。相比之下，练习多个大小的力的组表现得最好，而只进行了85次175N目标试验的组的结果介于这两组之间。这些组之间的表现差异在第一次保留测试中最为明显。但是这三组在最后5次保留测试中表现得差不多。这一结果在另一个实验（Shea & Kohl, 1991）中得到了复现。

Similarly, Travlos (1999) also reported that increasing the amount of practice beyond a certain number of trials resulted in poorer transfer test performance. In this experiment, participants attempted to learn the distance of a horizontal line by touching a digitizing tablet with a stylus at locations they estimated to be the beginning and end of the line. Although they could not see their movements, the participants received knowledge of results (KR) about their estimate in terms of the distance it deviated from the 8 in. criterion. Five groups experienced different amounts of practice: 42, 77, 102, 127, and 152 trials. At the end of practice, they performed a transfer test for five trials. This test required them to estimate the horizontal length of a 10 in. line. The results, which you can see in figure 17.1, showed that at the end of practice, all groups performed similarly. However, performance on the transfer test showed the influence of the different amounts of practice. Those who practiced the task for 77 and 102 trials performed the transfer test with less error than those who did other amounts of practice trials. The transfer test results also showed that 42 practice trials were too few, and that 127 and 152 trials were too many, which means that additional practice beyond 102 trials led to a decrement in transfer test performance rather than an enhancement of it.
类似的，Travlos （1999）在实验中发现，在一定量的练习之上继续增加练习量会导致迁移测试的表现下降。在这项实验中，被试者要学习判断水平线的长度，具体方法是用手写笔在电子平板上圈出他们估计的某条水平线的起点和终点。尽管受试者看不到自己的动作，但是还是会得到关于他们估计的距离与8英寸的偏差值的结果反馈。五组受试者分别进行了数量不等的练习，分别是42次、77次、102次、127次和152次。练习结束后对所有受试者进行迁移测试，迁移测试的内容是要求他们估计长为10英尺的水平线。结果如图17.1所示，在练习结束时，各个组的表现相差无几。但是，练习量的不同造成了迁移测试表现的差异。那些进行了77次和102次练习的受试者比那些进行了其他次数练习的受试者在进行迁移测试时误差更小。迁移测试结果还显示，42次练习太少，127次和152次练习太多，也就是说超过102次的额外练习导致迁移测试表现下降，而不是上升。


In a more recent study, Lee and colleagues (Lee, Bhatt, Liu, Wang, & Pai, 2018) reported that providing older adults (> 73 yrs old) with more than 24 trials of tripping practice on a treadmill did not improve incidence of falls, balance, or stability beyond the 24 trials.
在一项更近的研究中，Lee 及其同事（Lee, Bhatt, Liu, Wang, & Pai, 2018）报告让老年人（> 73岁）在跑步机上进行多于24次的扰动练习[!! tripping practice是一种练习方法, 但是术语在线上查不到标准术语, 直译是"绊倒练习"]，并没有改善跌倒、平衡或稳定性的发生率，而是与24次练习的效果一致。


The significance of the results reported in these experiments is that they run counter to what most people would expect, that the best way to improve performance is to increase the amount of practice. The research described in this section showed that the addition of more practice beyond a certain amount did not improve retention and transfer test performance.
大多数人认为提高表现的最佳方法就是增加练习量，但这些实验结果却与人们的预期背道而驰，这也正是这些实验的意义所在。本节中描述的这些研究表明，在达到一定练习量之后，再加大练习量并不能提高保留测试和迁移测试的表现。

Why would more practice lead to poorer retention and transfer test performance than less practice? One reason could be that because the skills practiced in these experiments were so simple, boredom became a problem after a certain amount of practice. As a result, the learners reduced the amount of attention the task required to improve performance. Or, as Lee, Swinnen, and Serrien (1994) described it, the learners ceased to engage in the amount of *cognitive effort* required to improve task performance.
为什么继续加大练习量反而会导致保留测试和迁移测试的表现变差？一个原因是这些实验中的任务都太简单了，所以一旦练习达到了一定次数，无聊情绪就会出现，导致学习者减少了提高成绩所需的注意力。或者用 Lee、Swinnen和Serrie（1994）的话说，学习者不再投入提高任务表现所需的*认知努力*。

A second explanation relates to both the motor program–based and the dynamical systems theories concerning the importance of *practice variability,* which you studied in chapter 16. According to these theories, continued practice of the same movement can result in a decreasing capability to remember the movement as well as to transfer to a movement variation, whereas the practice of variations of the movement results in enhancing the capability to remember and transfer to a related movement (note that these theories don’t take into account the *especial skills* effect that was introduced in chapter 16). It is interesting to note in this regard that in the Shea and Kohl experiments, practice of criterion task variations resulted in better retention performance than the same amount of practice of the criterion task only. If these results were extended to performance on a transfer test, we would expect similar results.
另一种解释与基于运动程序的理论和动力系统理论都有关，强调第16章中讨论的*练习变异性*的重要性。根据这些理论，持续练习同一动作会导致记忆与迁移该动作的能力下降，而练习有变化的动作会增强记忆和迁移该动作的能力(注意，这些理论没有考虑第16章中介绍的*特殊技能*效应)。另一个有趣的现象是在 Shea 和 Kohl 的实验中，练习标准任务的多种变化形式相比于只练习标准任务标准任务会带来更好的保留测试表现。如果在迁移测试中进行类似的比较，结果也差不多。

**OVERLEARNING AND OTHER PRACTICE VARIABLES**
It can be useful for a learner to continue to practice a skill even though he or she can perform it successfully such practice increases the permanence of the person’s capability to perform the skill at some future time. However, the research investigating the overlearning strategy has shown rather conclusively that *the amount of practice is not the critical variable influencing motor skill acquisition.* The amount of practice invariably interacts with some other practice-related variable to yield optimal skill learning. You have seen this interaction with a number of practice-related variables, such as the type and frequency of augmented feedback and the variability of practice where specific types and uses of these variables have shown better or worse learning with the same amount of practice. To establish an optimal learning environment, the instructor and/or learner also must take other practice condition characteristics into account. It is important to note that this perspective does not mean that the amount of practice is unimportant. It does mean that the amount of practice cannot be considered in isolation, but in terms of its interaction with other practice condition variables.
即使学习者已经能成功完成某项技能，继续练习该技能还是有用的，这些练习会增加他在未来某个时间完成这项技能的能力的持久性。然而，调查过度学习策略的研究已经相当明确地表明，练习量并不是影响运动技能习得的关键变量。练习量总是与其他一些练习相关的变量相互作用，以产生最佳的技能学习效果。这种与练习量相互作用的其他一些练习相关的变量在前面已经提了许多，如增强反馈的类型和频率、以及练习的变异性等。在练习量相同的情况下，这些变量的类型和使用方式的差异导致学习效果变得更好或更差。因此，为了建立一个最佳的学习环境，教师和学习者还必须考虑其他练习条件的特点。需要注意的是，以上观点并不意味着练习量不重要，而是说练习量不能孤立地考虑，而是要综合考虑它与其他练习条件变量的相互作用。

**THE DISTRIBUTION OF PRACTICE**
**练习的分布**

Practice distribution (sometimes referred to as the spacing of practice) has been a popular topic for research in motor learning for many years. The most popular era for this study extended from the 1930s through the 1950s, when practice distribution was seen as a way to test learning theories popular at that time. However, researchers have continued to investigate practice distribution issues because of its relevance to applied settings in a variety of contexts.
练习分布（有时也称为练习间隔）多年来一直是运动学习研究领域的热门话题。这项研究最流行的时代是从20世纪30到50年代，当时练习分布被视为检验当时流行的学习理论的一种方式。不过由于练习分布与各种环境中的应用情境有关，直到现在，研究人员还在继续研究练习分布问题。

One of the issues that was the focus of much of the early research concerned the amount of rest people need between practice trials to ensure an optimal learning environment. At issue was the question of whether *massed or distributed* practice trials provided for better learning of motor skills. Some researchers argued that distributed practice was better; others maintained that it did not make much difference which spacing strategy an instructor followed.
许多早期研究关注焦点问题之一是为设定最佳的学习环境，练习者在每次练习之间需要多少休息量。这一问题的主要争论点是为了更好地学习运动技能，应该采用集中练习还是分散练习。一些研究者认为分散练习更好，而另一些人则坚持认为，采用哪种分布方式并没有太大区别。 

Although this early controversy focused on between-trial rest intervals, the study of practice distribution also concerns the amount of practice during each session of practice and the amount of rest between sessions. In this second practice distribution issue, the question of concern is whether it is better to have fewer but longer sessions or more but shorter sessions.
尽管早期对练习分布的研究研究集中在争论练习间的休息量，但这些研究也讨论了每节练习课上应该保证的练习量和每节练习课之间的休息量。关于后者，争议的焦点是练习课应该课次少但课程长度长还是应该课次多但课程长度短。

**DEFINING MASSED AND DISTRIBUTED PRACTICE**
**集中练习和分散练习的定义**

Researchers use the terms **massed practice** and **distributed practice** in a general way to distinguish practice distribution schedules rather than assign specific amounts of time, which would allow for more objective definitions for these terms. The best way to understand these terms is to know that each involves an active practice, or work time; and each involves a rest period. The terms massed and distributed are typically defined in relation to each other. This means that the relative lengths of the time for active practice and rest are the essential aspects of establishing definitions for the two terms. As typically used, a massed practice schedule involves longer active practice, or work time, and shorter rest periods than a distributed schedule. Although rather vague, these definitions are necessary because of the types of situations to which they apply. In this discussion, we will consider massed and distributed practice in terms of schedules for both between and within practice sessions.
研究人员通常把集中练习和分散练习这两个术语作为一种笼统区分不同的练习分布安排的方式，而不是为每个术语指定一个明确的时间量，尽管指定明确的时间量可以让这两个术语的定义更客观。为了理解这两个术语，首先要知道每种练习安排都包含主动的练习时间（或锻炼时间）以及休息时间，而”集中“和”分散“通常是相对于彼此而定义的，也就说给这两个术语下定义的重要参考是主动练习时间和休息时间的相对长度。[!! 这两句翻得非常拗口, 希望后期能润一下. ]一般来说，集中式的练习安排相比于分散式的时间安排，主动练习时间（或锻炼时间）更长，休息时间更短。尽管这里的定义相当模糊，但考虑到这些术语的适用情境，这个定义还是必要的。在本节中，我们将依序讨论练习课间和练习课上的集中练习和分散练习。 

When applied to the *length and distribution of practice sessions,* a *massed schedule* will have fewer practice sessions than a distributed schedule, with each massed practice session requiring more trials and/or longer practice time. A *distributed schedule,* on the other hand, will distribute the same amount of practice time across more sessions, so that each session is shorter than each session in the massed schedule; the distributed practice sessions must be extended over a longer period to achieve the same total amount of practice trials.
从*练习课的长度和分布*的角度来说，*集中练习*相对于分散练习，练习课的课次较少，但每节练习课上进行的练习更多或练习时间更长亦或二者兼有。另一方面，*分散练习*的总练习时间与集中练习相同，但课次更多，因此每节课都比采用集中练习的练习课短。如果采用分散练习，要到达相同的练习总量，练习周期必然比集中练习长。 

When these terms apply to the scheduling of practice within sessions, the focus is on the relative amount of time for active practice for a trial and the rest between trials. This means that a *massed schedule* will have either no rest or a very short rest interval between trials. A *distributed schedule* will have much longer rest intervals than a massed schedule. 
从每节练习课上的安排来说，要区分这两种练习安排主要看每次练习中的主动练习时间和每次练习之间的休息时间。也就是说*集中练习*要么在练习间没有休息，要么休息时间很短。而*分散练习*的休息间隔比集中练习长得多。

**THE LENGTH AND DISTRIBUTION OF PRACTICE SESSIONS**
**练习课的长度和分布**

For most instruction and rehabilitation situations, the primary practice distribution concern is how to schedule within and between practice sessions for a specified amount of practice time. As we described earlier in this chapter, many instruction and rehabilitation situations have specified limits for the amount of available practice time. For example, in most clinical applications, a patient may receive treatment for only a limited number of sessions because of health care management restrictions. Also, in teaching and coaching situations, there is often little flexibility in the number of days available for classes or practice sessions. For example, if a teacher has only ten days for a unit of instruction, then the practice schedule must fit that limit. Similarly, if a dancer must perform in a concert that is one month away, then the rehearsal schedule must adjust accordingly. Thus, outside limitations may determine how many days a person should devote to practice. However, the instructor, coach, or therapist still decides the number of practice sessions and the length of each one.
在大部分指导和康复情境中，在练习分布方面主要关注的是在指定的练习时间内如何安排每节练习课和练习课之间的时间。本章之前提到，许多指导和康复情境都规定了可用练习时间的限制。例如，在大多数临床情境中，由于健康护理安排的限制，患者接受的治疗次数可能是有限的。此外，在教学和辅导的情境中，可用于上课或练习的天数通常没有多少灵活性。比如，如果一个老师只有十天的教学时间，那么练习安排必须符合这个限制。同样，如果一个舞者一个月后必须在音乐会上表演，那么排练时间安排也必须做出相应调整。因此，外界的限制可能会决定一个人应该花多少天去练习。然而，指导者、教练或治疗师仍然要决定练习的次数和每次练习的时间。

**The Benefit of More and Shorter Sessions**
**多而短的安排方式的好处**

Research on the question of the length and distribution of practice sessions shows support for *the benefit of distributed practice.* This means that when experiments have compared a few long practice sessions with more frequent and shorter sessions, the results show that practicing skills during shorter sessions leads to better learning.
关于练习长度和分布问题的研究支持了*分散练习的好处*。也就是说实验人员比较了进行几次长时间练习与进行更频繁的短时练习这两种方式，结果发现短时练习带来的学习效果更好。

A classic example of research supporting this general conclusion is a study published many years ago by Baddely and Longman (1978). They were attempting to determine the best way to schedule training sessions for postal workers on a mail-sorting machine, which required operating a typewriter-like keyboard. The postal service had allotted a total of 60 hours and 5 days each week for training the workers. Although this available training time could be distributed in a variety of ways in terms of number of training sessions, the researchers distributed this amount of time in four different ways, which are described in table 17.1 in the Practice Schedule column. Two groups trained for one hour in each session. One of these two groups practiced for only one session each day, which resulted in a total training time of twelve weeks, whereas the second group had two sessions each day, thereby reducing the number of weeks in training to 6. Two other groups practiced for two hours in each session. One of these groups had only one session each day, whereas the other had two sessions per day. These latter two groups therefore had six weeks and three weeks of training, respectively. These four schedules illustrate the variety of ways the researchers distributed 60 hours of practice. The *most distributed schedule* required workers to train for twelve weeks, whereas the *most massed schedule* allowed them to complete their training in only three weeks. The primary difference between these schedules was in how long each session was and how many sessions occurred each day.
支持这个一般结论的一个经典的例子是 Baddely 和 Longman（1978）多年前发表的一项研究。他们在研究中试图确定为邮政工作人员准备的邮件分拣机操作课程怎样安排才是最佳的。操作这种分拣机需要使用一种类似打字机的键盘。邮政部门总共安排了60个小时的培训时间，每周培训5天。尽管可用练习时间可以依照练习课的次数做出很多种分配方式，研究人员只采用了四种不同的分配方式（如表17.1中练习安排一列所示）。有两组受试者每次练习课只练习1小时。这两组中有一组每天只安排一节练习课，因此总的训练时间跨度为12周；另外一组每天安排了两节练习课，因此总的训练跨度就降为了周。还有两组受试者每次练习课练习2小时：一组每天只安排一次练习课，而另一组每天安排了两次练习课。这两组的训练时间跨度分别为6周与3周。这四种安排方式描述了研究人员安排60小时练习时间的各种方式，其中，*最分散的练习*需要受试者练习12周，而*最集中的练习*只要3周就可以全部完成。这些时间安排间最大的差异就在于每节练习课的长度以及每天进行的练习课的次数。

The results of this study are shown in table 17.1, which describes the number of hours the trainees required to achieve a typing speed of 80 keystrokes per minute, which was the motor performance goal for their training. Notice that only one of the four schedules (the most distributed schedule) resulted in the workers achieving this goal in the allotted training time of 60 hours (they did it in 55 hours). The other three groups required additional practice time. It is interesting that those in the most massed schedule group, which practiced two 2-hour sessions each day, never achieved this goal. After 80 hours of practice they were still doing only a little better than 70 keystrokes per minute.
研究结果如表17.1所示，该表描述了受训者达到每分钟击键80次（训练的运动表现目标）的速度所需的小时数。四周安排方式中只有一种（最分散的练习）使受训者在规定的60小时培训时间内实现了这一目标（他们用了55小时就实现了这一目标），而 其他三组都还需要额外的练习时间。值得注意的是，那些每天练习两次2小时的最集中练习组的受训者从来没有达到这个目标：经过80个小时的练习，他们的速度仍然只比每分钟击键70次强一点点。

Retention tests were given 1, 3, and 9 months after the workers had finished training. After 9 months, the most massed group performed worse on the typing speed test than the other groups, which performed about equally. Finally, the researchers obtained a very revealing result from the trainees’ own ratings of the training schedules. Although most workers preferred their own schedule, those in the most massed group preferred theirs the most, whereas members of the most distributed liked theirs the least. Interestingly, these preferences were exactly opposite to the performance test results.
研究人员在练习结束后的第1、3和9个月对受训者进行了保留测试。在保留测试中，最集中练习组在按键速度测试上的表现差于其他三组，而另外三组则表现地大致相同。最后，研究人员从学员自己对培训安排的评分中获得了一个非常有启发性的结果。虽然大多数学员更喜欢自己采用的时间安排，但在最集中练习组中尤甚，而采用最分散练习的受训者却最不喜欢自己的时间安排。非常有趣，这种偏好和在测试中的表现情况完全相反。

The results of this experiment indicate that fitting 60 hours of training into 3-week, where there had to be two 2-hour practice sessions each day, was a poor practice schedule. Although those in the most distributed schedule generally attained performance goals in the shortest time, they did not perform any better than two of the other groups on the retention tests. Given all the results, the authors concluded that the one-hour training sessions were more desirable than the two-hour sessions, and that one session per day was only slightly more effective than two sessions per day. However, having two 2-hour sessions each day was not a good training schedule.
这个实验的结果表明，将60个小时的训练安排在3周内导致每天必须进行两次2小时的练习是一个糟糕的练习计划。尽管最分散练习组一般能在最短的时间内达到表现目标，但他们在保留测试中的表现并不比其他两个小组好。综合所有结果，作者得出这样的结论，即一个小时的练习课比两个小时的练习课更可取，每天一次课比每天两次课稍微有效。但是，每天进行两次2小时的训练并不是一个好的计划。

More recent studies have shown similar learning benefits for distributed practice for a variety of motor skills, as the following examples demonstrate. Annett and Piech (1985) found that two 5 trial training sessions separated by one day led to better learning of a computer target-shooting game than one 10 trial session. One trial involved shooting at ten singly presented moving targets. On a retention test given one day after the end of the training session, the distributed group not only had more “hits” but also had less error in the shooting attempts.
最近的研究表明，分散练习对各种运动技能都有类似的好处。例如，Annett 和Piech（1985）发现，相隔一天进行两次练习，每次练习进行5次尝试比进行一次练习，在练习中进行10次尝试在电脑打靶游戏技能的学习上能取得更好的效果。在这个实验中，每次尝试都需要向十个单独出现的移动目标进行射击。在训练结束后一天进行的保留测试中，分散练习不仅有更多的“命中”，而且在射击过程中的失误也更少。 

Bouzid and Crawshaw (1987) reported similar results for the learning of word processing skills. Typists who practiced twelve skills during two sessions of 35 and 25 min each, separated by a 10 min break, required less time to learn the skills and had fewer errors on a test than typists who practiced the skills during one 60 min session.
Bouzid 和 Crawshaw（1987）报告在打字技能的学习中也有类似结果。在两次练习课（一次35分钟，一次25分钟，中间有10分钟的休息时间）中练习12项技能的打字员相较于在一次60分钟的练习课上练习相同技能的打字员，不仅学习技能所需要的时间更短，在测试中出现的错误也更少。

Shea et al. (2000) showed that distributing practice sessions across days resulted in better learning than massing all the sessions within one day for a continuous dynamic balance task and a discrete key-press timing task. The results for the continuous balance task are shown in figure 17.2. Note that for the first session of trials (each trial involved 90 sec of continuous balancing), both the one-day practice (massed) and the two-day practice (distributed) groups performed similarly. However, during the second practice session the groups began to perform differently. By the end of this session, the distributed group, for whom this session was the next day, had significantly less balancing error. Importantly, this difference continued during the retention test, which each group performed one day after the end of the practice sessions.
Shea 等人的研究（2000）表明，对于连续的动态平衡任务和离散的适时按键任务，在几天内进行分散练习相比在一天内进行集中练习能产生更好的学习效果。连续平衡任务的结果如图17.2所示。无论是一天练习组（集中练习）还是两天练习组（分散练习）在第一节练习课（练习课上要进行若干次尝试，每次尝试需要连续平衡90秒）上的表现都差不多。但两组的表现在第二次练习课中就出现了差异。到这次练习课结束时，分散练习组（对他们来说这次课安排在第二天）的平衡误差显著降低。而且，这种差异在练习课结束一天后的保留测试中仍然存在。


Finally, in a study involving learning to putt in golf, Dail and Christina (2004) had novice golfers practice putting a 3.7 m distance for 240 trials. One group followed a massed practice schedule in which they performed all the trials on one day, with short breaks between blocks of 10 trials. In contrast, another group practiced according to a distributed schedule of 60 trials per day for four consecutive days. The results, which you can see in figure 17.3, showed that at the end of 240 practice trials, the distributed practice group performed at a higher level than the massed schedule group. More importantly, this difference continued one and seven days later on retention tests of 60 trials. It is also interesting to note that at the end of each block of 10 trials during the practice sessions the experimenters asked the participants to predict their performance on the retention test. For this assessment of their own competence (i.e., metacognition), the participants who experienced the distributed schedule more accurately predicted their retention test performance.
最后，在一项关于学习高尔夫推杆的研究中，Dail 和 Christina （2004）让高尔夫球初学者练习推杆3.7米，总共进行了240次尝试。一组采用集中练习，在一天内完成所有的尝试，每10次尝试之间有短暂的休息。相比之下，另一组被试者采用分散练习，连续四天、每天进行60次尝试。结果如图17.3所示，在240次尝试结束后，分散练习组比集中练习组表现得更好。更重要的是，这种差异在一天和七天后进行的保留测试（进行60次尝试）中继续存在。有趣的是，在练习过程中，每进行一组10次的练习，实验者就要求参与者预测他们在保留测试中的表现，也就是要求他们对自身能力进行评估（即元认知）。结果表明，采用分散练习的受试者更准确地预测了他们在保留测试中的表现。

Taken together, the results of these experiments support the learning advantage of distributed over massed practice schedules when the number and length of practice sessions is the concern. And when considered in terms of the types of motor skills involved in the experiments, the benefit of distributed practice extends to a variety of types of skills, which include discrete and continuous skills as well as open and closed skills. Finally, although the research does not give us a specific number and length of practice sessions that would be optimal for the learning of all motor skills, the conclusion that shorter and more practice sessions lead to better learning than longer and fewer sessions provides an excellent general principle on which to base specific decisions when planning practice, training, or rehabilitation sessions.
总的来说，这些实验的结果支持了以下结论：就练习课次数和练习课时长而言，分散练习较集中练习更有优势；就实验中涉及的运动技能类型而言，分散练习的益处可以扩展到各种类型的技能，包括离散技能与连续技能以及开放技能和闭锁技能。最后，虽然这些研究没有给出普适于各种运动技能学习的最佳的练习课次数和时长，但是练习课越短越多相较于练习课越长越少带来的学习效果更好，这一结论可以作为一个很好的一般性原则，在规划练习、训练或康复计划时可以根据这个原则做出具体的安排。

**Explanations for the Distributed Practice Benefit**
**对分散练习的好处的解释**

There are at least three possible reasons why the distribution of practice sessions across more days leads to better learning than massing the sessions within fewer days. One is that *fatigue* negatively influences learning for massed practice schedules. Although none of the experiments discussed in this section assessed participants’ levels of fatigue, it is possible to suspect that fatigue influenced learning because of the task performance requirements. For example, in the Shea et al. (2000) experiment, participants performed a continuous dynamic balance task for 90 sec on each trial. The massed practice schedule required them to perform 14 trials on the same day with only a 20 min break between trials 7 and 8. On the other hand, participants in the distributed practice schedule performed the second set of seven trials on the following day. Similarly in the Dail and Christina (2004) experiment, participants who experienced the massed practice schedule performed 240 putts in one session, with short rest breaks only after each set of 10 trials. In contrast, those who practiced according to the distributed schedule performed only 60 trials in each session.
至少有三个可能的原因可以解释为什么在更长的时间内进行的分散练习会比在更短的时间内进行的集中练习会带来更好的学习效果。其中一个原因是*疲劳*会对集中练习产生负面影响。虽然本节中讨论的实验都没有评估被试者的疲劳程度，但考虑到实验中对任务执行的要求，还是可以猜测疲劳影响了学习。例如，在Shea 等人（2000）的实验中，参与者要在每次尝试中执行持续90秒的动态平衡任务。集中练习法要求他们在同一天进行14次尝试，仅在第7次尝试和第8次尝试之间有20分钟的休息时间。另一方面，采用分散练习法的被试者则是在第二天进行才执行第二组的7次尝试。类似地，在 Dail 和Christina（2004）的实验中，采用集中练习法的被试者在要在一次练习课中完成240次推杆动作，仅在每组10次尝试后有短暂的休息时间。相比之下，那些采用分散练习法的被试者在每次练习课中只进行了60次尝试。

Second, the massing of practice within a day or a few days may reduce the amount of *cognitive effort* used on each trial as practice continues beyond a certain critical amount. We considered this explanation earlier in this chapter when we discussed reasons why more practice beyond a certain amount could lead to diminished learning. The massing of practice trials may institute a practice condition in which performance of the skill on each trial becomes so repetitious that it becomes monotonous or boring. As a result, the learner begins to decrease the amount of cognitive effort involved in each trial, which in turn diminishes the level of learning.
hhh第二，在一天或几天内大量练习可能会减少每次试验中使用的认知努力量，因为练习会持续超过某个临界量。我们在本章早些时候讨论超过一定量的练习会导致学习能力下降的原因时，考虑了这个解释。大量的练习试验可能会形成一种练习条件，在这种条件下，每次试验中技能的表现都变得如此重复，以至于变得单调或乏味。因此，学习者开始减少每次试验中涉及的认知努力量，这反过来会降低学习水平。

The possibility that either or both fatigue and reduced cognitive effort accounted for the poorer learning that resulted from the massed compared to the distributed practice sessions can be seen in the results of the Shea et al. (2000) and Dail and Christina (2004) experiments. As you can see in figure 17.2, lower practice performance in the Shea et al. study did not begin until the last several trials for the massed practice condition. This suggests that as participants continued to practice, the effects of fatigue and/or reduced cognitive effort eventually began to influence their performance in a negative way. And this influence affected not only their practice performance but also their retention test performance, indicating an influence on their learning the skills.
在Shea等人(2000)和Dail及Christina (2004)的实验结果中可以看出，疲劳和认知努力的减少中的一种或两种都是造成与分布式练习会话相比聚集导致的较差学习的原因。如图17.2所示，Shea等人研究中较低的练习成绩直到massed练习条件的最后几次试验才开始。这表明，随着参与者继续练习，疲劳和/或认知努力减少的影响最终开始以负面方式影响他们的表现。这种影响不仅影响了他们的练习成绩，还影响了他们的记忆测试成绩，表明了对他们技能学习的影响。

The third explanation relates to *memory consolidation,* which is a long-term memory storage process. The memory consolidation hypothesis proposes that to store in memory the relevant information we need to learn a skill, certain neuro-biochemical processes must occur. These processes, which transform a relatively unstable memory representation into a relatively permanent one, require a certain amount of time without additional practice of the same skill. The distribution of practice across several days provides a better opportunity for the memory consolidation process to take place than does the massing of practice within a day or a few days (see Brashers-Krug, Shadmehr, & Bizzi, 1996; Shadmehr & Brashers-Krug, 1997; Simmons, 2011). In addition, sleep appears to make an important contribution to the consolidation process (e.g., Boutin et al., 2018; Walker, Brakefield, Morgan, Hobson, & Stickgold, 2002).
第三种解释与记忆巩固有关，记忆巩固是一个长期的记忆储存过程。记忆巩固假说认为，为了在记忆中储存我们学习技能所需的相关信息，某些神经生化过程必须发生。这些过程将相对不稳定的记忆表现转化为相对永久的记忆表现，需要一定的时间，而无需额外练习相同的技能。与一天或几天内的大量练习相比，几天内的练习分布为记忆巩固过程提供了更好的机会。

**THE INTERTRIAL INTERVAL AND PRACTICE DISTRIBUTION**
**尝试间间隔与练习分布**

By far the greatest amount of research on the distribution of practice has investigated the length of the intertrial interval, which relates to the amount of rest a person has between practice trials. One of the problems confronted when trying to understand this research relates to the definition problem described earlier in this chapter.
到目前为止，大部分关于练习分布的研究都在探讨尝试间间隔的时长，也就是练习者在两次练习尝试之间的休息时间。要理解这些研究，会遇到的一个问题与本章前面提到定义问题有关。

To elaborate on the general definitions presented earlier, we shall define *massed practice* as practice in which the amount of rest between trials is either very short or nonexistent, so that practice is relatively continuous. *Distributed practice* is practice in which the amount of rest between trials or groups of trials is relatively long. Although the terms “very short” and “relatively long” in these definitions are somewhat ambiguous, they allow us to generalize as much as possible from the research literature on massed versus distributed practice to motor skill learning situations.
为了详细说明前面介绍的一般定义，我们把“集中练习”定义为两次尝试之间的休息时间很短或没有休息时间的练习，因此练习是相对连续的。*分散练习*则指两次尝试或两组尝试之间的休息时间相对较长的练习。虽然定义中的用到的术语“很短”和“相对较长”有些模糊，但已足够让我们尽可能地将关于集中练习和分散练习的研究文献中的情境推广到运动技能学习的情境。

**A History of Controversy**
**有关争议的整理**

Although a great deal of research literature exists concerning the distribution of practice as it relates to the length of the intertrial interval, it is filled with controversy about which schedule leads to better learning. The controversy is evident in reviews of this literature as well as motor learning textbooks; both provide a variety of answers to the practice distribution question.
尽管有大量探讨尝试间间隔的时长的练习分布研究，但在关于哪种安排方式会带来更好的学习效果的问题上充满了争论。这一争论在相关文献的综述以及运动学习教科书中显而易见，因为两者上都为练习分布问题提供了多种答案。 

*Two problems* underlie the controversy surrounding this issue. The first relates to the issue of practice performance versus learning effects. Many of the experiments on massed versus distributed practice did not include retention or transfer trials. The second problem is that researchers generally have failed to consider that the two practice distribution schedules may have different learning effects on different types of skills.
这一争议之下主要有两个问题。第一个问题和练习表现与学习效果有关，因为许多关于集中练习与分散练习的实验并没有包含保留测试或迁移测试。第二个问题是，研究人员普遍没有考虑到这两种练习安排方式可能对不同类型的技能有着不同的学习效果。 

Two reviews of the distributed practice research literature have helped resolve these problems and the controversy about which practice schedule is better for learning motor skills (Donovan & Radosevich, 1999; Lee & Genovese, 1988). Both reviews involved a statistical analysis, known as meta-analysis, to evaluate the research literature. Their conclusion was that the *type of task* was an important variable in determining practice distribution effects for schedules related to the length of intertrial rest intervals. More specifically, Lee and Genovese (1988, 1989) provided evidence that the type of practice distribution schedule that results in better learning depends on whether the skill is continuous or discrete. We will look at each of these types of skills next.
有两份对分散练习研究文献的研究综述有助于解决上述问题以及哪种练习方式会带来更好的学习效果的争议（Donovan & Radosevich, 1999; Lee & Genovese, 1988）。这两份综述都使用了一种称为元分析[!! 此处建议加译者注，叙事式的 review 和 meta-analyses 正好是两种典型的 review 类型,我感觉还是这个概念还是挺重要的]的统计分析方法以评估研究文献。他们的结论是，*任务类型*是决定尝试间意义上的练习分布的效果的一个重要变量。更具体地说，Lee 和 Genovese （1988, 1989）提供的证据表明，哪种练习方式会带来更好的学习效果取决于技能是连续的还是离散的。接下来，我们分别讨论这两种技能。

***Continuous skills.*** Continuous skills have been the most common type of motor skills used to investigate the effects of massed versus distributed practice between trials. And the most popular task has been the rotary pursuit task, in which a person must keep a handheld stylus in contact with a small disk on a rotating turntable for as long as possible. A trial is usually a specified length of time, such as 20 or 30 sec. What makes this type of task useful for investigating the issue of massed versus distributed practice is that it is quite easy to specify massed and distributed intertrial interval lengths. Massed practice schedules typically have few, if any, seconds of rest between trials, whereas the intervals in distributed schedules are as long as or longer than the trials themselves. Because of this, researchers can establish intertrial interval lengths that are readily identifiable as distinctly massed or distributed. The Lee and Genovese (1988) review found that the consistent result has been that *distributed schedules lead to better learning* than massed schedules for learning continuous motor skills.
***连续技能*** 连续技能是用于研究尝试间意义上的集中练习和分散练习的效果的最常见的运动技能类型。这之中最流行的是旋转追踪任务，在这个任务中，受试者必须尽可能长时间地手持触控笔与一个旋转转盘上的小圆盘保持接触。每次尝试的时长通常已预先指定，如20或30秒。在关于集中练习与分散练习的研究中，这种任务之所以很有用，是因为可以轻而易举地确定集中练习和分散练习的尝试间间隔的时长：集中练习通常在尝试间只有很少的几秒休息时间（或者没有休息时间），而分散练习的尝试间间隔和尝试本身一样长或者比尝试本身还长。正因为如此，可以很容易地通过研究人员设定的尝试间间隔识别出是集中练习还是分散练习。Lee 和 Genovese （1988）的综述发现研究结果一致表明分散练习比集中练习在连续运动技能的学习上能产生更好的效果。 

***Discrete skills.*** When researchers use discrete skills to investigate the issue of intertrial massed versus distributed practice, a problem arises that is directly related to the definition problem we discussed earlier. If a massed schedule allows no rest between trials, whereas a distributed schedule involves a rest interval that is the same length as the practice trial, then the two contrasted intertrial intervals will be essentially the same length, because a discrete response is typically very short. For example, if people are practicing a rapid-aiming task that has a duration of approximately 150 msec, the distributed practice condition could, by definition, have a 150 msec intertrial interval. But if the massed condition had no rest between trials, only 150 msec would separate the two practice schedules. Thus, the operational definition of the terms “massed” and “distributed” becomes especially important in experiments using discrete tasks. Probably one reason this has not troubled researchers is that discrete tasks seldom have been used for comparing massed to distributed practice. In fact, in their comprehensive review, Lee and Genovese (1988) found only one study in the research literature that used a discrete task (Carron, 1969). The results of that study, and one subsequently reported by Lee and Genovese (1989), provided evidence that *massed practice schedules result in better learning* for discrete 
motor skills. Further support for this view was more recently provided in a study by Panchuk and colleagues (Panchuk, Spittle, Johnston, & Spittle, 2013) for learning a handball pass in Australian rules football. The skill is a discrete skill requiring a punch by one hand of a football held by the other hand as a way to pass the ball to a teammate. Their results showed massed practice of 1 sec. between trials led to better learning (as assessed by 10-min. and 2-week retention tests) than distributed practice of 30 sec. between trials.
***离散技能*** 当研究人员使用离散技能来研究集中练习与分散练习的问题时，出现了一个与我们前面讨论的定义问题直接相关的问题。按照前面的定义，集中练习不允许在尝试间休息，而分散练习则包含与尝试时间等长的休息间隔，但是考虑到离散技能的反应时间[!! discrete response,不确定是不是这个意思]通常非常短，两种本应起到对比作用的尝试间间隔基本上是一样长的。例如，考虑让被试者练习持续时间大约为150毫秒的快速瞄准任务，根据定义，分散式练习可以安排150毫秒的尝试间间隔。但是如果集中式练习是不安排尝试间间隔，那这两种安排方式的差异就只有150毫秒。因此，术语“集中”和“分布”的操作性定义在使用离散任务的实验中变得特别重要。不过研究者可能并没有被这个问题困扰，因为在比较集中练习和分散练习的研究中很少使用离散任务。事实上，在Lee 和 Genovese （1988）的综述中，他们只发现了一篇使用离散任务的研究文献（Carron, 1969）。该研究的结果以及随后由 Lee 和 Genovese （1989）报道的一项研究为*集中练习更有利于离散技能的学习*提供了证据。Panchuk 和他的同事 （Panchuk, Spittle, Johnston, & Spittle, 2013） 最近对学习澳式足球中的手球传球技能的研究进一步支持了这一观点。这是一种离散技能，需要一只手拿着足球，另一只手出拳击球以将球传给队友。他们的结果显示在两次尝试间休息1秒的集中练习比在尝试间休息30秒的分散练习效果更好（研究人员用来评估学习效果的方式是10分钟以及2周后的保留测试）。

**A Final Comment about Practice Distribution and Motor Learning**
***最后关于练习分布和运动学习的评论*

In this discussion of practice distribution effects on the learning of motor skills, an important distinction was made between two specific issues related to practice distribution: the length and frequency of practice sessions, and the length of the intertrial interval for a series of practice trials. These two issues are often overlooked as distinct even though research evidence supports the distinction. A significant reason for the distinction is that two different conclusions concerning how to best distribute practice are associated with each issue. When the length and frequency of practice sessions is the practice distribution concern, distributed practice results in better learning than massed practice, regardless of the type of skill being learned. On the other hand, when the length of the intertrial interval for a series of practice trials is the concern, the type of skill being learned is an important consideration. 
在讨论练习分布对运动技能学习的影响时，我们对练习分布进行了区分，区分为了练习课意义上的练习分布和尝试间间隔意义上的练习分布。前者关注练习课的课程长度和频率，后者则关注练习尝试之间的间隔时长。[!! 大改]尽管研究证据支持这二者间的差异，但这种差异往往还是被忽视了。[!! 这句原文很奇怪“as distinct”意义不明，和整段意思有冲突之嫌，可能我理解有误]之所以要做出这种区分，是因为在这两种练习问题上，关于最优的练习分配方式的结论是不同的。在练习课意义上，无论所学技能的类型为何，分散练习都会比集中练习产生更好的学习效果。另一方面，在尝试间间隔意义上，所学技能的类型则是需要考虑的一个重要因素。

**SUMMARY**
**本章小结**

Issues concerning the *amount of practice* needed to achieve specific skill performance goals historically have been discussed and investigated within the topic of *overlearning.*
关于达到特定技能表现目标所需的练习量的问题，历史上已经在*过度学习*的主题中被讨论和研究过。

Overlearning is the continuation of practice beyond the amount needed to achieve a certain performance criterion.
*过度学习*是指在练习量已经超过达到某个表现标准所需要的量后继续练习。

Research investigation of overlearning as a practice strategy has shown that the view that “more is better” is not always appropriate for the learning of motor skills, especially in terms of the benefits derived in relation to the amount of practice experienced; that is, there appears to be a *point of diminishing returns* for amount of practice.
把过度学习作为一种练习策略的研究调查表明，就练习量而言，“越多越好”的观点并不总适用于运动技能的学习；也就是说，练习量似乎存在*效益递减点*。

Research has shown that learning deficits can result when too much overlearning is involved in learning of motor skills that are simple and easy to learn; this effect is probably due to a decrease in the amount of cognitive effort applied after a certain amount of practice.
研究表明，在学习简单易学的运动技能时，过度学习会导致学习水平下降；这种效果可能是由于经过一定量的练习后，认知努力减少了。

Issues related to the *distribution of available practice time* involve massed and distributed practice schedules. The terms *massed* and *distributed* are generally defined in relation to each other according to the practice schedule characteristics of each.
与*可用练习时间分配*相关的问题包括集中练习与分散练习。*集中*和*分布*这两个术语通常是根据各自的练习安排特征而相互定义的。[!! 中文过于拗口]

One type of practice distribution schedule involves the *length and frequency of practice sessions;* this type typically concerns a massed schedule of longer sessions within a day or a few days compared to a distributed schedule of shorter sessions across more days than the massed schedule.
一种类型的练习分布关注练习课的课程长度和频率。这种意义上的练习分布中的集中练习通常指在一天内或几天内安排较长的练习课，相比之下，分散练习指的是在更多的天数内安排更短的练习课。

Research evidence shows that practice sessions can be too long and too infrequent to lead to optimal learning. Typically, better learning results when people practice skills in larger numbers of shorter practice sessions than when they do so in sessions that are long and fewer in number.
研究证据表明，练习课太长或频率太低都会导致无法达到最佳学习效果。通常，练习课短而多比练习课长而少带来的练习效果更好。

We discussed three hypotheses proposed to explain why distributed practice sessions lead to better learning than massed sessions: a fatigue hypothesis, a cognitive effort hypothesis, and a memory consolidation hypothesis.
我们讨论了三个假设，这三个假设被提出来解释为什么分布式练习会导致比集中练习更好的学习:疲劳假设、认知努力假设和记忆巩固假设。

The second type of practice distribution schedule involves the *length of the intertrial interval,* which is the rest period between practice trials.
另一种类型的练习分布关注*尝试间间隔的长度*，即两次练习尝试之间的休息时间。

Research evidence shows that the optimum length for the intertrial interval depends on whether the skill is continuous or discrete. For continuous skills, distributed practice schedules are typically better for learning, but massed practice schedules are preferable for discrete skills.
研究证据表明，最佳的尝试间间隔取决于技能是连续的还是离散的。对于连续技能，分散式练习通常更有利于学习，但对于离散技能，集中式练习更可取。

**POINTS FOR THE PRACTITIONER**
**实践要点**

**Overlearning:**
**过度学习：**

The overlearning strategy works best when the practitioner knows how much practice (i.e., number of trials or amount of time) a person needs to achieve a certain performance level.
当练习组织者知道练习者需要多少练习（即尝试的次数或时间）才能达到一定的表现水平时，过度学习策略的效果最佳。 

The overlearning strategy can be effective for skills that people will practice for a specified amount of time but then not perform for some period of time afterward (e.g., the disassembling and assembling of the machine gun in the Schendel and Hagman study).
过度学习策略对于那些人们会练习一段时间，但之后一段时间不练习的技能是有效的（比如Schendel 和 Hagman 对装卸机关枪的研究）。 

Practitioners should not base the amount of extra practice to provide on the view that “more is better.” There can be a point of diminishing returns where the extra practice does not yield results proportional to the amount of time and effort required by the extra practice, and the extra practice could actually lead to poorer test performance than would no extra practice. One way to determine the amount of extra practice is to require 100 percent more practice than the amount required by the person to achieve the specified performance criterion.
练习组织者不应该根据“越多越好”的观点来确定额外的练习量。因为可能存在效益递减点，即额外练习的效果与所需要的时间和精力不成正比，而且额外练习还可能导致测试表现的下降。确定额外练习量的一种方法是设定比达到规定的表现标准所需的练习量多100%的练习量。 

Practice requiring the performance of variations of skill characteristics can be an effective means of establishing an overlearning situation.
要求进行技能特征变化的练习可以成为建立过度学习情境的有效手段。

**Practice Distribution:**
**练习分布：**

Practice sessions can be too long. When in doubt about how long a session should be, opt for a shorter rather than a longer amount of time. If people need more practice time, add more sessions rather than lengthen sessions.
练习课长度可能会过长。如果不确定一节练习课到底应该多长，选择更短的时间而不是更长的时间。如果练习者需要更多的练习时间，增加更多的课时，而不是延长单次课的长度。 

More frequent practice sessions are preferable to fewer sessions.
安排频繁的练习课比较少的练习课更好。

Time saved in terms of the number of days of practice can be a false savings because massing sessions too close together can lead to poor long-term results.
密集安排练习课所带来的练习天数的节省可能是一种虚假的节省，因为这么做会导致长期效果不佳。 

The length and number of sessions desired by students, trainees, athletes, or patients may not represent the best schedule for learning the skills they need to learn. Remember that if the postal trainees in the Baddeley and Longman study had been allowed to choose their own training schedules, they would have chosen the schedule that led to the poorest learning.
学生、受训者、运动员或患者期望的练习周期或疗程的长度和与练习课/康复课次数可能并不是学习他们要学技能的最佳安排。在 Baddeley 和 Longman 研究中，如果受训的邮政工作者能自己选择的培训安排，他们会选择导致最差学习效果的那种安排。 

Make practice trials relatively short for skills that last a reasonably long time and require repetitive movements, such as swimming, bicycling, dancing, keyboarding, and piano playing. Shorter but more trials lead to better learning than longer trials that are infrequently repeated.
对于持续相当长时间并需要重复动作的技能（如游泳、骑自行车、跳舞、键盘和钢琴演奏），设定相对短的练习尝试。短而多的尝试比不常重复的较长尝试能带来更好的学习效果。 

For skills that require relatively brief amounts of time to perform (e.g., hitting a golf ball, serving a tennis ball, shooting a basketball, throwing darts, reach-and-grasp activities), make rest intervals between practice trials short.
对于需要相对较短时间来完成的技能（如打高尔夫球、网球发球、射篮、投掷飞镖、reach-and-grasp activities [!! 查不到标准翻译]），设定较短的尝试间休息间隔。

**A CLOSER LOOK**
**深入阅读**

**Relating Practice Distribution and Contextual Interference to Skill Learning Contexts**
**在技能学习情境中同时考虑练习分布与背景干扰**

The concept of contextual interference can be incorporated into practice distribution by organizing practice sessions to include principles related to both. The following are some examples that relate to three different skill learning contexts.
通过安排恰当的练习计划，练习课可以同时包含背景干扰效应和练习分布的基本原则。下面就是在三种不同的技能学习情境中进行这种安排的例子。

**Physical education class.** If several drills or other kinds of activity are planned for the day’s lesson, use a station-organization approach by assigning each skill or activity to a location in the gym or on the field so that there are several stations. Divide the class into groups and assign each to a station. Let the groups stay in their stations for about 12–15 minutes and then rotate to the next station. Continue this rotation approach for the entire period. If the class period is sufficiently long, allow for two or more rotations.
**体育课** 如果为一天的课程安排了几种练习或其他类型的活动，使用站点组织法，将每个技能或活动分配到体育馆或训练场地的一个位置，以形成几个站点。将班级分成小组，并给每个小组分配一个站点，让各组在各自的站点停留大约12-15分钟，然后轮换到下一个站点，并在整个训练周期内继续进行轮换。如果上课时间足够长，可以允许两次或更多的轮换。

**Sports-related practice.** Practices for team and individual sports typically include several activities. Rather than spend an extended amount of time on any one activity, divide in half the amount of time planned for each activity, and do each activity as two sets during practice. The two sets can be randomly or serially scheduled during the practice session.
**运动相关的练习** 无论是团体还是个人，对某项运动的练习通常包括几项活动。与其在任何一项活动上花费大量时间，不如将每项活动的计划时间一分为二，并以此在练习过程中将每项活动分成两组。这两组可以在练习期间随机安排或序列安排。

**Physical rehabilitation session.** Like sports-related practice sessions, rehab sessions typically involve several activities. If the planned activities allow, apply the approach described for sports-related practice by dividing in half the total amount of time planned for each activity, and do each activity as two randomly or serially scheduled sets during the session.
**身体康复疗程** 像体育相关的练习课一样，康复课通常也包括几项活动。如果计划的活动允许，应用上面描述的关于体育相关练习的方法，将每项活动计划进行的总时间一分为二，在康复课上随机安排或序列安排这两组活动。[!! 不好处理，直译很怪，只能这样译了，但相较原文损失了一些信息量，先标注一下，留待后面润色]

To enhance the learning of continuous motor skills, such as jumping rope, practice sessions should follow distributed schedules.
