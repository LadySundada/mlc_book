**APPLICATION**

Teachers, coaches, and therapists must make important decisions about the amount of practice people should engage in, as well as how much time to devote to various activities within and across practice sessions within the total amount of practice time available. In terms of the amount of practice needed to learn a skill, the conventional wisdom seems to be that the more practice a person has, the better his or her performance will be in some future situation. Consider some examples. It seems likely that a dance teacher would encourage a dancer who was a bit tentative in certain parts of a routine to spend as much time as possible going over the routine repeatedly in practice. A golf instructor would probably try to help a person be more successful with a certain shot by encouraging the person to spend as much time as possible on the practice range. Our experiences in situations like these lead us to accept the view that for improving performance “more practice is better.” But ironically, although this view of practice seems logical, research indicates that it is not always the best alternative. For example, as you saw in chapter 16 the same amount of practice can yield different learning results when practice follows different practice organization schedules. And, in chapter 15 you saw examples of the same amount of practice resulting in different learning outcomes depending on the frequency of augmented feedback. You will see another example of this type of effect in the Discussion section that follows.

教师、教练和治疗师必须认真思考要总共要安排多少的练习量，以及如何分配练习课课内和练习课之间进行各种活动的时间。在学习一项技能所需的练习量上，传统观点一般认为，一个人练习得越多，他未来在某些情况下的表现就会越好。比如，如果一位舞者对舞步中的某些部分不太熟悉，那他们的舞蹈老师就可能让他们花尽可能多的时间反复练习这个舞步。高尔夫教练如果想提高学员用某一种球杆击球时的表现，那他也可能会鼓励学员尽可能多地在练习场练习。 凡此种种都让我们认为，练习得越多，表现水平提升得也越大。但出人意料的是，尽管这种对于练习的观点似乎合乎逻辑，但研究表明，这并不总是最好的选择。比如在第16章我们了解到，相同的练习量，安排方式不同，产生的学习效果也不同。第15章也举了一些练习量相同但学习效果不同的的例子，在那些例子中学习效果与追加反馈的频率密切相关。在接下来的讨论中，你还会看到更多类似的例子。【、待回看

After having determined the amount of practice time people need to learn a motor skill, the practi­tioner needs to determine how much time to devote to various activities within and across practice sessions. 
He or she must determine the amount of time to devote to each activity in a session, the amount of rest between activities within a session, the length of each session, and the amount of time between sessions.

在确定学习一项运动技能所需的总练习时间后，安排练习的从业人员需要确定练习课课内和练习课之间进行各种活动的时间，包括一节练习课中分配给每种活动的时间、各个活动之间的休息时间、一节练习课的时长以及每节练习课之间的间隔。

If you are a physical education teacher organizing a volleyball unit, you need to determine how much time you should devote in each class period to working on the various skills, drills, and other activities that you plan to include. If you have determined the total amount of practice time you want to devote to a given activity in the unit, and you know how many class periods you will have in the unit, you will know how much time you need to spend in each class period on that activity.

假如你是一名体育教师，正在组织一个排球教学单元，你需要确定每节课上练习各种技能、操练和执行其他计划包括的活动各自应占多少时间。如果确定了该教学单元中某项活动的总练习时间，并且知道该单元中包含多少个课时，在每个课时中用于特定活动的时间也就确定了。

Similarly, if you are an athletic trainer or a physical or occupational therapist, you need to determine how much time an athlete or a patient will spend on each activity within a session, how much rest time you should allow between activities in a session, when the next session should be, and so on. You also may need to instruct the person concerning how to arrange his or her time schedule to do prescribed activities at home.

同样，假如你是一名运动训练师、物理治疗师或作业治疗师，你需要确定在一个疗程中运动员或病人为每项活动所花费的时间，每项活动之间的休息时间以及下一个疗程的开始时间等等。你还可能需要指导他们如何安排在家里做指定活动的时间。

**DISCUSSION**

The amount of practice a person devotes to a skill is critical for learning motor skills. This is especially the case when the person has the attaining of expertise as a goal. As we discussed in chapter 12, the impressive work by Ericsson and others has shown that expertise in any field is the result of intense practice for a minimum of ten years (Ericsson et al., 1993). Clearly, for achieving expertise, more practice is better than less. However, the amount of practice required to attain expertise is not our focus here. Instead, we will focus on the amount of practice a person needs to ensure achieving a specific performance goal associated with a specific period of practice.

在一项技能上投入的练习量对于运动技能的学习至关重要，尤其是要把这项技能发展为专长的时候。第12章中提到了 Ericsson 和其他研究人员提出的令人印象深刻的观点，即要在任何领域内取得一技之长都要至少经过十年的认真练习（Ericsson et al., 1993）。为了获得一技之长，自然是练得越多越好，但是获得一技之长需要的练习量并不是本章的重点。本章主要关注在一段特定的练习期中，为了达到特定的表现水平目标所需要的练习量。

There are many situations in which it is important to determine the amount of practice people should experience to achieve specific skill performance goals. Although limitations may exist in many of these situations in terms of the amount of time available for practice, the need to determine the amount of practice required remains. For example, a physical education teacher needs to determine the number of classes within a unit to devote to learning a specific activity. In sports settings, the amount of practice time available is typically restricted by a season’s schedule or by rules established by professional associations. And, in rehabilitation contexts, the amount of time available for therapy is typically restricted by health care provider agencies.

很多情境下都有必要确定为达到预定的表现水平目标，练习者需要投入的练习量。尽管这些情境中可用于练习的时间已经有了许多限制，但需要的练习量还是要规划的。比如，体育老师需要确定在一个教学单元中为某一特定的活动的学习分配的课时数。在体育相关的情境中，可用的练习时间通常会受到赛季时间安排或专业协会制定的规则的限制。而在康复相关的情境中，可用的治疗的时间通常受到医疗服务提供机构的限制。

As we address the issue of optimal amounts of practice, we will limit our discussion to these types of situations and establish some guidelines for the effective and efficient use of available practice time. As suggested by the examples we just considered, this limited focus is particularly relevant to those involved in settings that impose strict practice time limitations on teachers, coaches, and therapists.

所以，本章会限制在上述那些情境中讨论最佳练习量问题，同时会建立一些高效利用可用练习时间的准则。从刚刚举的那些例子可以看出，这种有限的关注对那些在有严格的练习时间限制的教师、教练以及治疗师来说特别有帮助。

**OVERLEARNING AND LEARNING MOTOR SKILLS**

**过度学习与运动技能学习**

Researchers historically have investigated the relationship between the amount of practice and the achievement of specific performance goals within the topic of *overlearning.* **Overlearning** is the continuation of practice beyond the amount needed to achieve a certain performance criterion. A teacher, coach, or therapist implements an overlearning strategy by establishing a specific performance criterion, such as a specific accuracy average for throwing a certain number of balls at a target. The teacher then requires students to achieve that performance criterion during class, record the number of trials it took for the student to reach that goal, and then require a specified number of additional practice trials, to implement an overlearning practice condition.

在历史上，研究人员曾以*过度学习*为课题研究了练习量与达成特定的技能表现目标之间的关系。如果练习量已经超过达到某个表现标准所需要的量，这时再继续练习，就是所谓的**过度学习**。比如在向目标投掷一定量的球的练习中的平均比准确度[!! 有点拗口，但specific accuracy就和比荷(specific charge)一样，直译过来就是比准确度，目前好像也没什么太好的翻译，就先这样，看看需不需要该]就可以是一个表现标准。这些标准通常由教师、教练或治疗师设定，用以实施过度学习。在设定完标准后，教师会要求学生进行练习以达到表现标准，并记录达到这一标准需要的练习次数，然后要求学生进行指定数量的额外练习以满足过度学习的条件。[!! 调了一些，应该没改变原意]

From a theoretical perspective, the assigning of extra practice has merit. According to a motor ­program–based motor learning theory, extra practice helps strengthen the generalized motor program and response schema for the skill a person is learning, so that the person can call it into action more readily when necessary. From a dynamical systems theory perspective, extra practice is a means by which a learner increases the stability of the coordination and control characteristics in the performance of the skill.

从理论的角度来看，分配额外的练习是有道理的。根据基于运动程序的运动学习理论，额外的练习有助于强化练习者正在学习的技能的概括化运动程序和反应模式，以便其在必要时能够更容易地将学习的技能付诸行动。从动力系统理论的角度来看，额外练习也是一种手段，学习者可以通过这种手段来提高技能表现过程中协调和控制特征的稳定性。

Driskell, Willis, and Copper (1992) reviewed and analyzed fifteen research studies that investigated several hypotheses related to overlearning. The first notable point about this review is that the issue of overlearning has not generated a great deal of research over the years. The fifteen studies covered research articles published from 1929 to 1982. However, these studies involved almost 4,000 subjects, which gives us a good basis for discerning the influence of overlearning on skill acquisition and how various factors influence overlearning. The results of this review indicated that for motor skill learning, overlearning has a positive influence on retention performance. And when extra practice of 50 to 200 percent was analyzed, the higher percentages resulted in relatively proportionate higher retention test performance.

Driskell，Willis 和 Copper（1992）分析回顾了15项调查了与过度学习有关的几个假设的研究。他们这篇综述的第一个值得注意的地方是，多年来，过度学习没有引起大量研究，这15项研究就涵盖了从1929年到1982年发表的研究文章。尽管如此，这些研究涉及近4000名受试者，这为我们区分过度学习对技能习得的影响以及了解各种因素如何影响过度学习提供了良好的基础。这篇综述的结果表明，在运动技能的学习中，过度学习对保留测试的成绩有积极的影响。同时在对50%到200%的额外练习的分析中发现，较高的百分比会相对成比例地提高保留测试的成绩。

Although the Driskell et al. (1992) review provides a comprehensive overview of overlearning as it relates to skill acquisition, it does not evaluate ­effects related to specific types of motor skills. ­Because motor learning research has shown that certain types of skills demonstrate some distinct characteristics with regards to over­learning, we will consider three examples in the following sections.

尽管 Driskell 等人（1992）的综述对与技能习得有关的过度学习提供了一个全面的概述，但它并没有评估过度学习对特定类型的运动技能的效果。然而运动学习的有关研究表明，某些类型的技能会在过度学习方面表现出一些明显的特征。因此，我们将在下面的章节中考虑三个例子。

**The Overlearning Strategy for Learning Procedural Skills**

**过度学习策略对程序性技能的影响**

*Procedural skills* constitute one type of motor skill particularly well suited to deriving benefits from an overlearning practice strategy. A procedural skill is an interesting combination of cognitive and motor components. Although this term was not included in chapter 1 in the discussion of types of skills, it is a relatively common term used in the training and functional skills literature. It typically requires a person to perform a series of movements that individually are relatively easy to execute. However, to accomplish the total task, the performer must know which movements to make and in what order. These types of skills are especially common in occupational, industrial, and military settings. For example, people perform procedural skills when their jobs require them to put together the components of a circuit board for a computer, or type from a written text.

*程序性技能*是运动技能的一种，过度学习练习策略对其尤其有效。程序性技能是认知成分和运动成分的有趣结合。虽然这个术语在第一章关于技能类型的讨论中没有被列入，但在有关训练和 functional skill [!!]的文献中是一个相对常用的术语。这种技能通常要求执行者完成一系列的动作：这些动作单独来说都是比较容易执行的，但是为了完成整个技能，执行者必须知道以何种顺序执行哪些动作。这些类型的技能在职场、工业界和军事环境中相当常见。例如组装计算机电路板的部件或打字录入纸本文件都是程序性技能。

A common problem with procedural skills is that people tend to forget what to do to carry out the entire procedure. This is particularly characteristic of procedural skills that they do not perform routinely every day. For example, several years ago, the U.S. Army was interested in improving the performance of soldiers for a procedural skill that involved assembling and disassembling machine guns. This skill was important to study because soldiers typically learned it in a short training period, but did not perform it again until sometime after training; it was not a routine part of their daily duties. The problem was that when they performed a later test on this skill, the soldiers typically showed a large decrement in performance, compared to how they had performed at the end of training. 
To overcome this problem, researchers for the U.S. Army Research Institute (Schendel & ­Hagman, 1982) ­proposed that an overlearning training strategy (which they referred to as *overtraining*) would be effective for decreasing the amount the soldiers forgot about the procedure.

执行程序性技能的过程中，一个普遍的问题是，执行者往往会忘记该怎么做才能完成整套程序。这个问题对那些不是每天都例行公事的程序性技能来说尤为显著。例如，几年前，美国陆军开始对提高士兵组装和拆卸机枪的程序性技能上的表现感兴趣。对这项技能的研究十分重要，因为这并不是士兵们的每天的常规任务：他们通常在短期训练中学会了这项技能，但直到训练结束后的某个时候才会再次执行。问题是，当军方后来对这项技能进行测试时，士兵们的表现与训练结束时的表现相比通常会大幅下降。为了解决这个问题，美国陆军研究所的研究人员（Schendel & Hagman, 1982）提出过度学习的训练策略（他们称之为*过度训练*）将有效地减少士兵对该程序的遗忘。

The researchers compared two forms of overtraining to a no-overtraining situation. One form was an “imme­diate” overtraining condition, which required soldiers to perform 100 percent more trials than they required to achieve a performance criterion of one correct ­assembly/disassembly trial. The second overtraining condition also involved an additional 100 percent more practice trials, but these trials were administered as “refresher” training midway through the eight-week retention interval used for all subjects. Results showed that both of these overtraining groups performed better than the no-overtraining control group on the retention test, which required the soldiers to practice until they were again able to assemble and disassemble the gun correctly on a trial. However, the two overtraining groups did not differ from each other in the number of trials it took to retrain to the criterion performance of one correct trial.

研究人员比较了两种形式的过度训练和无过度训练的情况。第一种过度训练形式是“立即过度训练”，即在达到一次正确组装/拆卸试验的表现标准后，再进行同样次数（100%）的额外练习。第二种形式也要求进行额外的100%的练习，只是这些练习是在所有受试者的八周保留时间间隔的中途作为“复习过度训练”进行的。之后研究人员进行了保留测试，要求士兵们进行练习，直到他们能够再次在试验中正确地组装和拆卸枪支。结果显示，这两个过度训练组在保留测试中的表现都比没有过度训练的对照组好。然而，两个过度训练组在重新训练到符合表现标准所需的练习次数上并无差异。

Based on the results of this experiment, the authors recommended the immediate overtraining procedure, because it was more cost- and time-­effective. Because the trainees were already in the training session, it would take less time and money to have them engage in additional practice there than to bring them back several weeks later for a ­refresher training session.

基于该实验的结果，论文作者建议采用立即过度训练的方法，因为这一方法更具成本效益和时间效益。因为受训者已经去参加了训练课程，让他们在那里进行额外的练习比让他们在几周后回来参加复习训练所花费的时间和金钱更少。

**The Overlearning Strategy for Learning Dynamic Balance Skills**

In an experiment that involved learning a skill that has less of a cognitive component than the gun assembly/disassembly skill, Melnick (1971) investigated the use of overlearning for a dynamic balance skill. This experiment continues to be the only one reported in the research literature that involves the overlearning of dynamic balance skills. In addition to addressing the question of whether practice beyond the amount the learner needed to achieve a performance criterion was beneficial, Melnick asked whether there was an optimal amount of extra practice. In this experiment, people practiced balancing on a stabilome­ter until they were able to achieve a performance criterion of being on ­balance 28 out of 50 sec. After achieving this criterion, each group was required to perform further ­trials in one of the following amounts: 0 percent (none), 50 percent, 100 percent, or 200 percent of the initial number of trials of practice. Then, all ­participants performed a retention test twice, one week and then one month after practice.

The results showed that all amounts of extra practice were beneficial. This means that all the groups that engaged in extra practice beyond what they needed to achieve the performance criterion performed better on the retention tests. More interesting, however, was the result that there was *a point of diminishing returns* for the amount of retention performance benefit in relation to the amount of extra practice. This effect can be seen in the results when the group that had 50 percent additional practice did as well on the retention tests as the groups that had 100 percent and 200 percent extra practice. So, ­although additional practice was beneficial, increasing the amount of additional practice beyond the 50 percent amount was not proportionally more beneficial to retention performance.

Supporting evidence for the lack of benefit for additional practice beyond a certain amount was reported by Kwakkel and ­Wagenaar (2002) for physical therapy sessions. ­Although this study did not focus on dynamic balance, it showed that providing additional physical therapy sessions each day during a five-day-per-week, twenty-week period did not result in additional benefits for stroke patients immediately after the onset of their stroke.

**The Overlearning Strategy in a Physical Education Class**

Researchers also have demonstrated the presence of the “diminishing returns” phenomenon for learning skills in physical education classes. A good example of this is an experiment by Goldberger and Gerney (1990). In a unit of instruction, fifth-grade boys and girls practiced several football skills. The goal of this unit was to help students improve their performance of these skills. To simplify matters, we will look only at the two-step football punt. One group practiced these skills according to a teacher-rotated format, in which the teacher divided the class into five subgroups and assigned each to one of five stations where they practiced a specified skill for 5 min. At the end of every 5 min, students rotated to a new station. Another group of students practiced according to a learner-rotated format: They received index cards describing what they needed to do at each station and then were told to use their 25 min efficiently to practice each skill. Everyone practiced like this for two class periods on two days. The next week, the students performed the skills in a test.

The results showed that the two groups differed in terms of the number of practice trials for this skill, but not in test performance. The teacher-­rotated format group actually practiced the skill an average of 7 more trials than the learner-rotated format group. Students in the learner-rotated format group performed from 0 to 67 trials, whereas students in the teacher-rotated group performed from 0 to 87 trials. But there was no difference between the groups in the amount of improvement in their punting performance scores. The additional amount of practice induced by the teacher-rotated format did not yield an additional skill performance improvement benefit on the retention test. Thus, given the time constraints of the unit of instruction, the learner-rotated format was superior, because it provided more efficient use of the available practice time.

**THE OVERLEARNING STRATEGY CAN LEAD TO POOR TEST PERFORMANCE**

Although the overlearning strategy typically benefits skill learning, some evidence shows that in addition to the diminishing returns phenomenon, learning deficits may result from providing *too many* extra practice trials. For example, Shea and Kohl (1990) reported an experiment in which participants learned to push a handle with a specified amount of force (175N). One group practiced this skill for 85 trials. Another group also practiced this skill for 85 trials, but in addition practiced the same skill at four other force goals (125N, 150N, 200N, and 225N) for 51 trials each, for a total of 289 practice trials. A third group practiced the skill with the 175N goal force for 289 trials. One day later, all participants engaged in a retention test in which they performed the skill with the goal force of 175N for 10 trials.

The results showed that the group that practiced the 175N goal force for 289 trials had the poorest 
performance on the initial 5 trials of the retention test. In contrast, the group that practiced the variable goals performed best. Results for the group that practiced only 85 trials of the 175N goal fell between those of the two other groups. The differences between these groups were most distinct on the first retention trial. However, on the final 5 trials of the retention test, all three groups performed similarly. These results were replicated in another experiment by the same authors (Shea & Kohl, 1991).

Similarly, Travlos (1999) also reported that increasing the amount of practice beyond a certain number of trials resulted in poorer transfer test performance. In this experiment, participants attempted to learn the distance of a horizontal line by touching a digitizing tablet with a stylus at locations they estimated to be the beginning and end of the line. Although they could not see their movements, the participants received knowledge of results (KR) about their estimate in terms of the distance it deviated from the 8 in. criterion. Five groups experienced different amounts of practice: 42, 77, 102, 127, and 152 trials. At the end of practice, they ­performed a transfer test for five trials. This test ­required them to estimate the horizontal length of ­a 10 in. line. The results, which you can see in figure 17.1, showed that at the end of practice, all groups performed similarly. However, performance on the transfer test showed the influence of the different amounts of practice. Those who practiced the task for 77 and 102 trials performed the transfer test with less error than those who did other amounts of practice trials. The transfer test results also showed that 42 practice trials were too few, and that 127 and 152 trials were too many, which means that additional practice beyond 102 trials led to a decrement in transfer test performance rather than an enhancement of it.

In a more recent study, Lee and colleagues (Lee, Bhatt, Liu, Wang, & Pai, 2018) reported that providing older adults (> 73 yrs old) with more than 24 trials of tripping practice on a treadmill did not improve incidence of falls, balance, or stability beyond the 24 trials.

The significance of the results reported in these experiments is that they run counter to what most people would expect, that the best way to improve performance is to increase the amount of practice. The research described in this section showed that the addition of more practice beyond a certain amount did not improve retention and transfer test performance.

Why would more practice lead to poorer retention and transfer test performance than less practice? One reason could be that because the skills practiced in these experiments were so simple, boredom became a problem after a certain amount of practice. As a result, the learners reduced the amount of attention the task required to improve performance. Or, as Lee, Swinnen, and Serrien (1994) described it, the learners ceased to engage in the amount of *cognitive effort* required to improve task performance.

A second explanation relates to both the motor program–based and the dynamical systems theories concerning the importance of *practice variability,* which you studied in chapter 16. According to these theories, continued practice of the same movement can result in a decreasing capability to remember the movement as well as to transfer to a movement variation, whereas the practice of variations of the movement results in enhancing the capability to ­remem­­­­ber and transfer to a related movement (note that these theories don’t take into account the *especial skills* effect that was introduced in chapter 16). It is interesting to note in this regard that in the Shea and Kohl experiments, practice of criterion task variations resulted in better retention performance than the same amount of practice of the criterion task only. If these results were extended to perfor­mance on a transfer test, we would expect similar results.

**OVERLEARNING AND OTHER PRACTICE VARIABLES**

It can be useful for a learner to continue to practice a skill even though he or she can perform it successfully such practice increases the permanence of the person’s capability to perform the skill at some future time. However, the research investigating the overlearning strategy has shown rather conclusively that *the amount of practice is not the critical variable influencing motor skill acquisition.* The amount of practice invariably interacts with some other practice-
related variable to yield optimal skill learning. You have seen this interaction with a number of ­practice-related variables, such as the type and frequency of augmented feedback and the ­variabi­­lity of practice where specific types and uses of these variables have shown better or worse learning with the same amount of practice. To establish an optimal learning environment, the instructor and/or learner also must take other practice condition characteristics into account. It is important to note that this perspective does not mean that the amount of practice is unimportant. It does mean that the amount of practice cannot be considered in isolation, but in terms of its interaction with other practice condition variables.

**THE DISTRIBUTION OF PRACTICE**

Practice distribution (sometimes referred to as the spacing of practice) has been a popular topic for research in motor learning for many years. The most popular era for this study extended from the 1930s through the 1950s, when practice distribution was seen as a way to test learning theories popular at that time. However, researchers have continued to investigate practice distribution issues because of its relevance to applied settings in a variety of contexts.

One of the issues that was the focus of much of the early research concerned the amount of rest people need between practice trials to ensure an optimal learning environment. At issue was the question of whether *massed or distributed* practice trials provided for better learning of motor skills. Some researchers 
argued that distributed practice was better; others 
maintained that it did not make much difference which spacing strategy an instructor followed.

Although this early controversy focused on ­between-trial rest intervals, the study of practice distribution also concerns the amount of practice during each session of practice and the amount of rest between sessions. In this second practice distribution issue, the question of concern is whether it is better to have fewer but longer sessions or more but shorter sessions.

**DEFINING MASSED AND
DISTRIBUTED PRACTICE**

Researchers use the terms **massed practice** and **distributed practice** in a general way to distinguish practice distribution schedules rather than ­assign specific amounts of time, which would allow for more objective definitions for these terms. The best way to understand these terms is to know that each involves an active practice, or work time; and each involves a rest period. The terms massed and distributed are typically defined in relation to each other. This means that the relative lengths of the time for active practice and rest are the essential aspects of establishing definitions for the two terms. As typically used, a massed practice schedule involves longer active practice, or work time, and shorter rest periods than a distributed schedule. Although rather vague, these definitions are necessary because of the types of ­situations to which they apply. In this discussion, we will consider massed and distributed practice in terms of schedules for both between and within practice sessions.

When applied to the *length and distribution of practice sessions,* a *massed schedule* will have fewer practice sessions than a distributed schedule, with each massed practice session requiring more trials and/or longer practice time. A *distributed schedule,* on the other hand, will distribute the same amount of practice time across more sessions, so that each session is shorter than each session in the massed schedule; the distributed practice sessions must be extended over a longer period to achieve the same total amount of practice trials.

When these terms apply to the scheduling of practice within sessions, the focus is on the relative amount of time for active practice for a trial and the rest between trials. This means that a *massed schedule* will have either no rest or a very short rest interval between trials. A *distributed schedule* will have much longer rest intervals than a massed schedule. 

**THE LENGTH AND DISTRIBUTION 
OF PRACTICE SESSIONS**

For most instruction and rehabilitation situations, the primary practice distribution concern is how to schedule within and between practice sessions for a specified amount of practice time. As we described earlier in this chapter, many instruction and rehabilitation situations have specified limits for the amount of available practice time. For example, in most clinical applications, a patient may ­receive treatment for only a limited number of sessions because of health care management restrictions. Also, in teaching and coaching situations, there is often little flexibility in the number of days available for classes or practice sessions. For example, if a teacher has only ten days for a unit of instruction, then the practice schedule must fit that limit. Similarly, if a dancer must perform in a concert that is one month away, then the rehearsal schedule must adjust accordingly. Thus, outside limitations may determine how many days a person should devote to practice. However, the instructor, coach, or therapist still decides the number of practice sessions and the length of each one.

**The Benefit of More and Shorter Sessions**

Research on the question of the length and distribution of practice sessions shows support for *the benefit of distributed practice.* This means that when experiments have compared a few long practice sessions with more frequent and shorter sessions, the results show that practicing skills during shorter sessions leads to better learning.

A classic example of research supporting this general conclusion is a study published many years ago by Baddely and Longman (1978). They were attempting to determine the best way to sched­ule training sessions for postal workers on a mail-­sorting machine, which required operating a typewriter-like keyboard. The postal service had allotted a total of 60 hours and 5 days each week for training the workers. Although this available training time could be distributed in a variety of ways in terms of number of training sessions, the researchers distributed this amount of time in four different ways, which are described in table 17.1 in the Practice Schedule column. Two groups trained for one hour in each session. One of these two groups practiced for only one session each day, which resulted in a total training time of twelve weeks, whereas the second group had two sessions each day, thereby reducing the number of weeks in training to 6. Two other groups practiced for two hours in each session. One of these groups had only one session each day, whereas the other had two sessions per day. These latter two groups therefore had six weeks and three weeks of training, respectively. These four schedules illustrate the variety of ways the researchers distributed 60 hours of practice. The *most distributed schedule* required workers to train for twelve weeks, whereas the *most massed schedule* allowed them to complete their training in only three weeks. 
The primary difference between these schedules was in how long each session was and how many sessions occurred each day.

The results of this study are shown in table 17.1, 
which describes the number of hours the trainees required to achieve a typing speed of 80 keystrokes per minute, which was the motor perfor­mance goal for their training. Notice that only one of the four schedules (the most distributed schedule) resulted in the workers achieving this goal in the allotted training time of 60 hours (they did it in 55 hours). The other three groups required additional practice time. It is interesting that those in the most massed schedule group, which practiced two 
2-hour sessions each day, never achieved this goal. After 80 hours of practice they were still doing only a little better than 70 keystrokes per minute.

Retention tests were given 1, 3, and 9 months after the workers had finished training. After 
9 months, the most massed group performed worse on the typing speed test than the other groups, which performed about equally. Finally, the researchers obtained a very revealing result from the trainees’ own ratings of the training schedules. Although most workers preferred their own schedule, those in the most massed group preferred theirs the most, whereas members of the most distributed liked theirs the least. Interestingly, these preferences were exactly opposite to the performance test results.

The results of this experiment indicate that fitting 60 hours of training into 3-week, where there had to be two 2-hour practice sessions each day, was a poor practice schedule. Although those in the most distributed schedule generally attained performance goals in the shortest time, they did not perform any better than two of the other groups on the retention tests. Given all the results, the authors concluded that the one-hour training sessions were more desirable than the two-hour sessions, and that one session per day was only slightly more effective than two sessions per day. However, having two 2-hour sessions each day was not a good training schedule.

More recent studies have shown similar learning benefits for distributed practice for a variety of motor skills, as the following examples demonstrate. Annett and Piech (1985) found that two 5 trial training sessions separated by one day led to better learning of a computer target-shooting game than one 10 trial session. One trial involved shooting at ten singly presented moving targets. On a retention test given one day after the end of the training session, the distributed group not only had more “hits” but also had less error in the shooting attempts.

Bouzid and Crawshaw (1987) reported similar results for the learning of word processing skills. Typists who practiced twelve skills during two sessions of 35 and 25 min each, separated by a 10 min break, required less time to learn the skills and had fewer errors on a test than typists who practiced the skills during one 60 min session.

Shea et al. (2000) showed that distributing practice sessions across days resulted in better learning than massing all the sessions within one day for a continuous dynamic balance task and a discrete key-press timing task. The results for the continuous balance task are shown in figure 17.2. Note that for the first session of trials (each trial involved 
90 sec of continuous balancing), both the one-day practice (massed) and the two-day practice (distributed) groups performed similarly. However, during the second practice session the groups began to perform differently. By the end of this session, the distributed group, for whom this session was the next day, had significantly less balancing error. Importantly, this difference continued during the retention test, which each group performed one day after the end of the practice sessions.

Finally, in a study involving learning to putt in golf, Dail and Christina (2004) had novice golfers practice putting a 3.7 m distance for 240 trials. One group followed a massed practice schedule in which they performed all the trials on one day, with short breaks between blocks of 10 trials. In contrast, another group practiced according to a distributed schedule of 60 trials per day for four consecutive days. The results, which you can see in figure 17.3, showed that at the end of 240 practice trials, the distributed practice group performed at a higher level than the massed schedule group. More importantly, this difference continued one and seven days later on retention tests of 60 trials. It is also interesting to note that at the end of each block of 10 trials during the practice sessions the experimenters asked the participants to predict their performance on the retention test. For this assessment of their own competence (i.e., metacognition), the participants who experienced the distributed schedule more accurately predicted their retention test performance.

Taken together, the results of these experiments support the learning advantage of distributed over massed practice schedules when the number and length of practice sessions is the concern. And when considered in terms of the types of motor skills involved in the experiments, the benefit of distributed practice extends to a variety of types of skills, which include discrete and continuous skills as well as open and closed skills. Finally, although the research does not give us a specific number and length of practice sessions that would be optimal for the learning of all motor skills, the conclusion that shorter and more practice sessions lead to better learning than longer and fewer ­sessions provides an excellent general principle on which to base specific decisions when planning practice, training, or rehabilitation sessions.

**Explanations for the Distributed 
Practice Benefit**

There are at least three possible reasons why the distribution of practice sessions across more days leads to better learning than massing the sessions within fewer days. One is that *fatigue* negatively influences learning for massed practice schedules. Although none of the experiments discussed in this section assessed participants’ levels of fatigue, it is possible to suspect that fatigue influenced learning because of the task performance requirements. For example, in the Shea et al. (2000) experiment, ­participants performed a continuous dynamic balance task for 90 sec on each trial. The massed practice s­chedule ­required them to perform 14 trials on the same day with only a 20 min break between trials 7 and 8. On the other hand, participants in the distributed practice schedule performed the second set of seven ­trials on the following day. Similarly in the Dail and Christina (2004) experiment, participants who experienced the massed practice schedule performed 240 putts in one session, with short rest breaks only after each set of 10 trials. In contrast, those who practiced according to the distributed schedule performed only 60 trials in each session.

Second, the massing of practice within a day or a few days may reduce the amount of *cognitive effort* used on each trial as practice continues beyond a certain critical amount. We considered this explanation earlier in this chapter when we discussed reasons why more practice beyond a certain amount could lead to diminished learning. The massing of practice trials may institute a practice condition in which performance of the skill on each trial becomes so repetitious that it becomes monotonous or boring. As a result, the learner begins to decrease the amount of cognitive effort involved in each trial, which in turn diminishes the level of learning.

The possibility that either or both fatigue and reduced cognitive effort accounted for the poorer learning that resulted from the massed compared to the distributed practice sessions can be seen in the results of the Shea et al. (2000) and Dail and Christina (2004) experiments. As you can see in figure 17.2, lower practice performance in the Shea et al. study did not begin until the last several trials for the massed practice condition. This suggests that as participants continued to practice, the effects of fatigue and/or reduced cognitive effort eventually began to influence their performance in a negative way. And this influence affected not only their practice performance but also their retention test performance, indicating an influence on their learning 
the skills.

The third explanation relates to *memory consolidation,* which is a long-term memory storage process. The memory consolidation hypothesis proposes that to store in memory the relevant information we need to learn a skill, certain neuro-­biochemical processes must occur. These processes, which transform a relatively unstable memory representation into a relatively permanent one, require a certain amount of time without additional practice of the same skill. The distribution of practice across several days provides a better opportunity for the memory consolidation process to take place than does the massing of practice within a day or a few days (see Brashers-Krug, Shadmehr, & Bizzi, 1996; Shadmehr & Brashers-Krug, 1997; ­Simmons, 2011). In addition, sleep appears to make an important contribution to the consolidation process (e.g., Boutin et al., 2018; Walker, Brakefield, Morgan, Hobson, & ­
Stickgold, 2002).

**THE INTERTRIAL INTERVAL 
AND PRACTICE DISTRIBUTION**

By far the greatest amount of research on the distribution of practice has investigated the length of the intertrial interval, which relates to the amount of rest a person has between practice trials. One of the problems confronted when trying to understand this research relates to the definition problem described earlier in this chapter.

To elaborate on the general definitions presented earlier, we shall define *massed practice* as practice in which the amount of rest between trials is either very short or nonexistent, so that practice is relatively continuous. *Distributed practice* is practice in which the amount of rest between trials or groups of trials is relatively long. Although the terms “very short” and “relatively long” in these definitions are somewhat ambiguous, they allow us to generalize as much as possible from the research literature on massed versus distributed practice to motor skill learning situations.

**A History of Controversy**

Although a great deal of research literature exists concerning the distribution of practice as it relates to the length of the intertrial interval, it is filled with controversy about which schedule leads to better learning. The controversy is evident in reviews of this literature as well as motor learning textbooks; both provide a variety of answers to the practice distribution question.

*Two problems* underlie the controversy surrounding this issue. The first relates to the issue of practice performance versus learning effects. Many of the experiments on massed versus distributed practice did not include retention or transfer trials. 
The second problem is that researchers generally have failed to consider that the two practice 
distribution schedules may have different learning effects on different types of skills.

Two reviews of the distributed practice research literature have helped resolve these problems and the controversy about which practice schedule is better for learning motor skills (Donovan & Radosevich, 1999; Lee & Genovese, 1988). Both reviews involved a statistical analysis, known as meta-analysis, to evaluate the research literature. Their conclusion was that the *type of task* was an important variable in determining practice distribution effects for schedules related to the length of intertrial rest intervals. More specifically, Lee and Genovese (1988, 1989) provided evidence that the type of practice distribution schedule that results in better learning depends on whether the skill is continuous or discrete. We will look at each of these types of skills next.

***Continuous skills.***Continuous skills have been the most common type of motor skills used to investigate the effects of massed versus distributed practice between trials. And the most popular task has been the rotary pursuit task, in which a person must keep a handheld stylus in contact with a small disk on a rotating turntable for as long as possible. A trial is usually a specified length of time, such as 20 or 30 sec. What makes this type of task useful for investigating the issue of massed versus distributed practice is that it is quite easy to specify massed and distributed intertrial interval lengths. Massed practice schedules typically have few, if any, seconds of rest between trials, whereas the intervals in distributed schedules are as long as or longer than the trials themselves. Because of this, researchers can establish intertrial interval lengths that are readily identifiable as distinctly massed or distributed. The Lee and Genovese (1988) review found that the con­sistent result has been that *distributed schedules lead to better learning* than massed schedules for learning continuous motor skills.

***Discrete skills.***When researchers use discrete skills to investigate the issue of intertrial massed versus distributed practice, a problem arises that is directly related to the definition problem we discussed earlier. If a massed schedule allows no rest between ­trials, whereas a distributed schedule involves a rest interval that is the same length as the practice trial, then the two contrasted intertrial intervals will be essentially the same length, because a discrete response is typically very short. For example, if people are practicing a rapid-­aiming task that has a duration of approximately 150 msec, the distributed practice condition could, by definition, have a 150 msec intertrial interval. But if the massed condition had no rest between trials, only 150 msec would separate the two practice schedules. Thus, the operational definition of the terms “massed” and “distributed” becomes especially important in experiments using discrete tasks. Probably one reason this has not ­troubled researchers is that discrete tasks seldom have been used for comparing massed to distributed practice. In fact, in their comprehensive review, Lee and Genovese (1988) found only one study in the research literature that used a discrete task (Carron, 1969). The results of that study, and one subsequently reported by Lee and Genovese (1989), provided evidence that *massed practice schedules result in better learning* for discrete 
motor skills. Further support for this view was more recently provided in a study by Panchuk and colleagues (Panchuk, Spittle, Johnston, & Spittle, 2013) for learning a handball pass in ­Australian rules football. The skill is a discrete skill requiring a punch by one hand of a football held by the other hand as a way to pass the ball to a teammate. Their results showed massed practice of 1 sec. between trials led to better learning (as assessed by 10-min. and 2-week retention tests) than distributed practice of 30 sec. between trials.

**A Final Comment about Practice Distribution and Motor Learning**

In this discussion of practice distribution effects on the learning of motor skills, an important distinction was made between two specific issues related to practice distribution: the length and frequency of practice sessions, and the length of the intertrial interval for a series of practice trials. These two issues are often overlooked as distinct even though research evidence supports the distinction. A significant reason for the distinction is that two different conclusions concerning how to best distribute practice are associated with each issue. When the length and frequency of practice sessions is the practice distribution concern, distributed practice results in better learning than massed practice, regardless of the type of skill being learned. On the other hand, when the length of the intertrial interval for a series of practice trials is the concern, the type of skill being learned is an important consideration. 

**SUMMARY**

Issues concerning the *amount of practice* needed to achieve specific skill performance goals historically have been discussed and investigated within the topic of *overlearning.*

Overlearning is the continuation of practice beyond the amount needed to achieve a certain performance criterion.

Research investigation of overlearning as a practice strategy has shown that the view that “more is better” is not always appropriate for the learning of motor skills, especially in terms of the benefits derived in relation to the amount of practice experienced; that is, there appears to be a *point of ­diminishing returns* for amount of practice.

Research has shown that learning deficits can result when too much overlearning is involved in learning of motor skills that are simple and easy to learn; this effect is probably due to a decrease in the amount of cognitive effort applied after a certain amount of practice.

Issues related to the *distribution of available practice time* involve massed and distributed practice schedules. The terms *massed* and *distributed* are generally defined in relation to each other according to the practice schedule characteristics of each.

One type of practice distribution schedule involves the *length and frequency of practice sessions;* this type typically concerns a massed schedule of longer sessions within a day or a few days compared to a distributed schedule of shorter sessions across more days than the massed schedule.

Research evidence shows that practice sessions can be too long and too infrequent to lead to optimal learning. Typically, better learning results when people practice skills in larger numbers of shorter practice sessions than when they do so in sessions that are long and fewer in number.

We discussed three hypotheses proposed to explain why distributed practice sessions lead to better learning than massed sessions: a fatigue hypothesis, a cognitive effort hypothesis, and a memory consolidation hypothesis.

The second type of practice distribution schedule involves the *length of the intertrial interval,* which is the rest period between practice trials.

Research evidence shows that the optimum length for the intertrial interval depends on whether the skill is continuous or discrete. For continuous skills, distributed practice schedules are typically better for learning, but massed practice schedules are preferable for discrete skills.

**POINTS FOR THE PRACTITIONER**

**Overlearning:**

The overlearning strategy works best when the practitioner knows how much practice 
(i.e., number of trials or amount of time) a person needs to achieve a certain performance level.

The overlearning strategy can be effective for skills that people will practice for a specified amount of time but then not perform for some period of time afterward (e.g., the disassembling and assembling of the machine gun in the Schendel 
and Hagman study).

Practitioners should not base the amount of extra practice to provide on the view that “more is better.” There can be a point of diminishing returns where the extra practice does not yield results ­proportional to the amount of time and effort required by the extra practice, and the extra practice could actually lead to poorer test performance than would no extra practice. One way to determine the amount of extra practice is to require 100 percent more practice than the amount required by the person to achieve the specified performance criterion.

Practice requiring the performance of variations of skill characteristics can be an effective means of establishing an overlearning situation.

**Practice Distribution:**

Practice sessions can be too long. When in doubt about how long a session should be, opt for a shorter rather than a longer amount of time. If people need more practice time, add more sessions rather than lengthen sessions.

More frequent practice sessions are preferable to fewer sessions.

Time saved in terms of the number of days of practice can be a false savings because massing sessions too close together can lead to poor long- term results.

The length and number of sessions desired by students, trainees, athletes, or patients may not represent the best schedule for learning the skills they need to learn. Remember that if the postal trainees in the Baddeley and Longman study had been allowed to choose their own training schedules, they would have chosen the schedule that led to the poorest learning.

Make practice trials relatively short for skills that last a reasonably long time and require repetitive movements, such as swimming, bicycling, dancing, keyboarding, and piano playing. Shorter but more trials lead to better learning than longer trials that are infrequently repeated.

For skills that require relatively brief amounts of time to perform (e.g., hitting a golf ball, serving a tennis ball, shooting a basketball, throwing darts, reach-and-grasp activities), make rest intervals between practice trials short.

**A CLOSER LOOK**

**Relating Practice Distribution and Contextual Interference to Skill Learning Contexts**

The concept of contextual interference can be incorporated into practice distribution by organizing practice sessions to include principles related to both. The following are some examples that relate to three different skill learning contexts.

**Physical education class.** If several drills or other kinds of activity are planned for the day’s lesson, use a station-organization approach by assigning each skill or activity to a location in the gym or on the field so that there are several stations. Divide the class into groups and assign each to a station. Let the groups stay in their stations for about 12–15 minutes and then rotate to the next station. Continue this rotation approach for the entire ­period. If the class period is sufficiently long, ­allow for two or more rotations.

**Sports-related practice.** Practices for team and individual sports typically include several activities. Rather than spend an extended amount of time on any one activity, divide in half the amount of time planned for each activity, and do each activity as two sets during practice. The two sets can be randomly or serially scheduled during the practice session.

**Physical rehabilitation session.** Like sports-­related practice sessions, rehab sessions typically involve several activities. If the planned activities allow, apply the approach described for sports-­related practice by dividing in half the total amount of time planned for each activity, and do each activity as two randomly or serially scheduled sets during the session.

To enhance the learning of continuous motor skills, such as jumping rope, practice sessions should follow distributed schedules.
