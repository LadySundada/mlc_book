**APPLICATION**

**应用**

A primary reason a person practices a skill is to increase his or her capability of performing it in future situations that will require the skill. For example, a basketball player needs to be successful shooting free throws in games. A student in a physical education class who will receive a grade based on performance on skills tests wants to practice those skills in ways that will lead to a high level of performance on the tests. Dancers need to perform in recitals, ­performances, and competitions. Athletic trainers practice taping an ankle or knee so they can do it ­effectively and quickly with athletes when needed. And physical rehab patients practice skills so that they can perform them as needed in their everyday environment. Because of this future performance ­requirement, teachers, coaches, athletic trainers, and therapists must design and establish practice conditions that will lead to the greatest probability of successful performance in situations that will require the practiced skills.

一个人练习某项技能的主要原因是为了提高执行这项技能的能力, 以便在未来需要的时候派上用场。例如，一个篮球运动员需要在比赛中成功地投掷罚球。体育课会根据学生在技能测试上的表现打分，这门课上的学生就希望通过练习这些技能得以在测试中有高水平的表现。舞者需要在个人专场，公开演出以及舞蹈比赛上表演。运动训练师要练习绑扎脚踝或膝盖，以便在需要时能高效快速地对运动员进行绑扎。正在进行体质康复的患者也需要练习某些技能，用以满足日常生活的需要。出于对未来表现的要求，教师、教练、运动训练师都必须设计和确定练习条件，以便能在需要时最大可能地成功执行这些练习过的技能。

Consider two more specific examples. Suppose you were taking golf lessons, and your instructor told you to go to the practice range and hit a basket of practice balls. You know you need practice hitting your long irons. What would be the best way for you to spend your practice time using your long irons so that you can improve your performance with those irons when you play a round of golf on the golf course? Or suppose you are a physical therapist working with a patient who recently had knee replacement surgery. You want the patient to work on ascending and descending stairs. What would be the most effective way to schedule the practice of these two tasks to facilitate your ­patient’s capability to ascend and descend the stairs in his or her home every day?

考虑两个更具体的例子。假设你在上高尔夫课，你的教练让你去练习场打一篮子练习球。你知道你需要练习挥打你的长铁杆。为了提高在高尔夫球场上用这些铁杆击球的表现水平，你在用长铁杆练习的时候最好应该怎么做？或者，假如你是一名物理治疗师，正在帮助与一名最近做过膝关节置换手术的患者复健。你想让病人进行上下楼梯的训练。怎样才能最有效地安排这两项任务的练习，以促进你的病人每天在家里上下楼梯的能力？

One practice characteristic that increases the chances for future performance success is the variability of the learner’s experiences while he or she practices. This includes variations of the characteristics of the context in which the learner performs the skill, as well as variations of the skill he or she is practicing. The practitioner must address several important questions to determine how to optimize the types and amount of variation to include in practice experiences. First, what aspects of performing the skill should he or she vary? Second, how much variety of experiences is optimal? Third, how should the variety of experiences be organized in the practice sessions? We consider these questions in the discussion that follows.

能够提高未来表现水平的练习具有这样一个特点，就是学习者在练习过程中的体验要具有变化。这包括学习者进行技能练习的环境特征的变化，以及他正在练习的技能本身的变化。为了确定如何优化练习体验中变化的类型和数量，练习者必须解决几个重要的问题。首先，技能的哪些方面需要变化？其次，练习过程有多少变化才是最佳的？最后，如何把这些变化组织到练习过程中？在接下来的讨论中，我们就要来考虑这些问题。

**DISCUSSION**

**讨论**

The theories of motor skill learning and control we have discussed in this book, consistently emphasize the learning and performance benefits derived from practice ­variability. In these theories, **practice variability** refers to the variety of movement and context characteristics the learner experiences while practicing a skill. For example, in Schmidt’s (1975) schema the­ory, a key prediction is that successful future performance of a skill depends on the amount of movement variability the learner experiences during practice. Similarly, Gentile’s learning stages model (1972, 2000) emphasized the learner’s need during practice to experience variations of regulatory and nonregulatory context characteristics. And dynamical systems views of skill learning stress the learner’s need to explore the perceptual motor workspace and to discover optimal solutions to the degrees of freedom problem posed by the skill (e.g., McDonald, Oliver, & Newell, 1995; Vereijken & Whiting, 1990).

我们在本书中讨论的运动技能学习和控制的理论，一直都在强调练习的变异性对技能学习和技能表现的好处。在这些理论中，**练习变异性**（practice variability）是指学习者在练习一项技能时体验到的各种动作特征和环境特征的变化。例如，Schmidt （1975）的模式理论中的一个关键的假设是，一项技能能否在未来成功表现取决于学习者在练习中所体验到的动作变化的数量。Gentile 的学习阶段模型（1972,2000）也强调学习者在练习过程中需要体验调节环境特征和非调节环境特征的差异。技能学习的动力系统观点也强调学习者需要探索知觉工作空间（perceptual motor workspace），并找出技能控制自由度问题的最佳解法（例如, McDonald, Oliver, & Newell, 1995; Vereijken & Whiting, 1990）。

**THE FUTURE PERFORMANCE BENEFIT OF PRACTICE VARIABILITY**

**练习变异性有助于未来表现**

An important benefit a learner derives from practice experiences that promote movement and context variability is an increased capability to perform the skill in a future test situation. This means that the person has acquired an increased capability not only to perform the practiced skill itself, but also to ­perform the skill in novel conditions that might <u>characterize the test situation</u>, such as in a competitive event. When viewed from the perspective of transfer of learning, where the transfer of interest is from practice to the test, the inclusion of movement and context variability in practice can be seen as a means of enhancing positive transfer from the practice to the test contexts.

从具有动作和环境变化的练习体验中，学习者得到的一个重要好处是提高了在未来测试中执行该技能的能力。这意味着学习者不仅提高了执行所练习技能本身的能力，而且还能在可能<u>表征测试情景</u>的新环境下执行技能，例如在竞赛项目中。<font color='red'>[!! 这里*characterize*的意思是*to give something its typical or  most noticeable qualities or features*, 如果要用中文完整表达这层意思太拖沓, 所以我这里就用了词典上的翻译"表征", 但总感觉这样翻可能会让读者摸不着头脑]</font>从学习迁移的角度来看，我们感兴趣的是练习到测试的迁移，而在练习中引入动作和环境的变化可以看作是为增强从练习环境到测试环境的正迁移而采取的一种手段。

**Variable versus Constant Practice**

**变异练习与固定练习**

One way to establish that practice variability benefits future performance is to compare the effects on retention or transfer test performance of practice situations involving one variation of a skill (i.e., *constant practice*) with those involving several variations of the skill (i.e., *variable practice*). This type of comparison has been the standard research strategy for testing Schmidt’s (1975) schema theory hypothesis that greater amounts of variable practice lead to ­better learning than lesser amounts. Although an ­abun­dance of published research studies have investigated and generally supported this hypothesis (see van Rossum, 1990, for a review of this research), two examples will illustrate these studies.

确定练习变异性有利于未来表现的一种方法是，比较涉及某种技能的一种形式的练习（即固定练习）和涉及该技能的几种形式的练习（即变异练习）对保留测试成绩或迁移测试成绩的影响。这种方法被普遍用于验证 Schmidt（1975）模式理论的假设，即练习形式变化多的练习相比于形式变化少的练习能达成更好的学习效果。尽管已有大量研究验证并支持这一假设（关于这些研究的回顾，请见 van Rossum,1990），我们只举两个最具代表性的例子。

In two experiments, Shea and Kohl (1990, 1991) had participants learn to apply 175N of force while pressing a handle. One experimental group, the constant practice group, practiced only this skill for 289 trials, while a variable practice group practiced producing four different amounts of force (125N, 150N, 200N, and 225N). Notice that none of the amounts of force practiced by the variable practice group was the 175N goal. When both groups performed a retention/transfer test for the 175N goal (the test was a retention test for the constant group but a transfer test for the variable group), the variable group performed more accurately than the constant group.

在 Shea 和 Kohl (1990, 1991)的两个实验中，被试者要学习用175N的力按下手柄。其中一个实验组，即固定练习组，在289次试验中只练习施加175N的力，而变异练习组则要练习施加四种不同的力（125N、150N、200N和225N）。需要注意的是，变异练习组所练习的四种大小的力全都不是要测试的目标（175N）。当两组都以175N为目标进行保留/迁移测试时（该测试对固定组是保留测试，对变异组是迁移测试），变异组表现得比固定组更准确。

Variable practice was also shown to result in better learning than constant practice in an experiment involving a sports skill (Shoenfelt, Snyder, Maue, ­McDowell, & Woolard, 2002). In this study, participants practiced shooting basketball free throws. The results, which can be seen in figure 16.1, showed that the constant practice group, which practiced only from the free-throw line, improved during the three weeks of practice, but two weeks later on a retention test, returned to their pretest level of perfor­mance. On the other hand, three variable practice groups, only one of which included shooting from the free-throw line, improved during practice and performed on the retention test at a higher level than they had on the pretest. 

在一项涉及运动技能的实验中，变异练习的结果也比固定练习的结果要好（Shoenfelt, Snyder, Maue,McDowell, & Woolard, 2002）。在这项研究中，被试者要练习篮球罚球。结果如图16.1所示，在练习的三周内，只在罚球线上练习的固定练习组的成绩确实有所提高，但在两周后的保留测试中，他们成绩又落回了测试前的水平。另外三个变异练习组（其中只有一组练习了罚球线上投篮）的水平不仅在练习过程中有所提高，而且在保留测试中的表现也比他们在测试前的水平要高。

­­**Performance errors benefit learning.** An apparent irony concerning the benefit of an increased amount of practice variability is that it is usually ­associated with an *increased amount of perfor­mance error during practice.* However, this relationship is consistent with research evidence that shows more performance error can be better than less error for skill learning, when it occurs in the initial learning stage. A good example of this evidence is an experiment by Edwards and Lee (1985). Each partici­pant had to learn to move his or her arm through a specified pattern in 1,200 msec. Participants in the prompted group engaged in practice designed to minimize performance errors. They were told that if they moved according to a “ready and 1, 2, 3, 4, 5” count on a tape, they would complete the movement in the criterion time. Each ­person practiced until he or she could do three trials in a row correctly at 1,200 msec. Those in the trial-and-error group were told the goal movement time and received knowledge of results (KR) about their timing error after each trial. The results indicated that the two groups performed similarly on the retention test, but the trial-and-error group performed more accurately on a transfer test when both groups had to move in a different amount of time, which was 1,800 msec.

**表现出错有利于学习**。一个显而易见却又出乎意料的事实是，练习变异性有助于技能学习，却也增加了练习中表现错误的数量。然而，这种现象与研究并不矛盾。研究表明，在学习的初始阶段，表现出错多可能比表现出错少更有利于技能的学习。Edwards 和 Lee（1985）的实验就是一个很好的例证。在这项实验中，每个被试者都要学会在1200毫秒内将手臂穿过一个指定的模型。提示组的被试者进行的是旨在最大限度减少表现出错的练习：他们被告知如果按照磁带上的 “预备，1，2，3，4，5 ”的节拍来移动他们的手臂，他们就可以在规定的时间内完成动作。每个被试者都要练习到能在1200毫秒的时间内连续三次正确完成试验为止。而试错组的被试者则被告知动作的目标用时，并在每次试验结束后得到关于用时误差的反馈。结果表明，在保留测试中，两组人的表现没有显著差异；但在迁移测试中，两组人被要求在与先前不同的目标时间（1800毫秒）内移动手臂，此时试错组表现得更准确。

What is particularly interesting about these results is how much the two groups differed in the amount of error each produced during practice. The prompted group performed with very little error during practice, whereas the trial-and-error group experienced much error, especially during the first fifteen trials. Yet experiencing less error during practice was not more beneficial for retention test performance, and it was detrimental for transfer to a novel variation of the practiced movement.

两组人在练习过程中的出错数量不尽相同，而我们特别关注的是两组人的出错数量有多大的差异。提示组在练习过程中很少出错，而试错组则出错很多，尤其是在头15次试验中。然而，在练习过程中少出错对保留测试并没有什么特别的好处，而且还不利于动作的迁移。

Similar results have been reported in a physical rehabilitation setting. For example, when acute stroke patients were instructed, by either a trial-and-error or errorless learning method, to put on a sock, those who practiced by trial-and-error performed better on a transfer test that involved a variation of the practiced task (Mount, Pierce, Parker, DiEgidio, Woessner, & Spiegel, 2007). Although the physical rehabilitation research literature presents some evidence that shows the benefits of instructional strategies that minimize the amount of performance errors by people with specific cognitive disorders (see Mount et al., 2007, for a brief review of this research), the effectiveness of “errorless” learning strategies does not carry over to healthy populations and it has not been replicated consistently in people with cognitive disorders. 

在身体康复领域中也报道过类似结果。例如，分别用试错学习法和无错学习法指导急性卒中患者穿袜子，采取试错法的患者在一项包含穿袜子任务的一个变化形式的迁移测试中取得了更好的成绩（Mount, Pierce, Parker, DiEgidio, Woessner, & Spiegel, 2007）。尽管身体康复领域中也有一些证据表明将表现出错量降到最低的教学策略对特定的认知障碍患者有好处（该研究的简要回顾可参见 Mount et al., 2007 ），但“无错”学习策略的有效性并没有延续到健康人群中，而且也没有在认知障碍患者中持续复现。

A study by Lee et al. (2016) has clarified that the nature of the errors made by learners, rather than the quantity of errors, seems to be the factor most responsible for the positive effects of errors on learning. Participants in the study learned a keypress sequencing task under conditions that varied the amount of information about which key to press next in the sequence and therefore encouraged different amounts of error. The primary finding was that retention of the sequences was better when more errors were made during practice. However, not all types of errors had the same beneficial effect on learning. <u>The benefits came from errors that gave learners an opportunity to fully engage in the error detection and correction processes that enabled them to evaluate their decision making strategies. In contrast, errors that were induced by making decisions difficult to evaluate during practice did not have the same facilitatory effect on learning.</u>

Lee（2016）等人的一项研究阐明，导致出错对学习产生积极影响的最重要因素似乎是学习者所犯错误的性质，而不是错误的数量。该研究中，被试者的任务是在不同的情景下学习按照一定顺序按键。不同情景下关于接下来按哪个键的信息量不同，因此产生了数量不等的错误。该研究最基本的发现是：在练习过程中出错越多，保留效果也越好。但是，并非所有类型的错误对学习有同样的好处。<u>好处来自于那些让学习者有机会充分参与错误识别和纠正过程的错误，这使得他们能够评估自己的决策策略。相比之下，在练习过程中因决策难以评估而引起的错误对学习没有同样的促进作用。</u><font color='red'>[!! 这两句翻的有点不知所云, 比如"决策难以评估"就不像人话, 还有很多改进空间. 实际上原始文献的 discussion 结合具体的实验方法把这些词解释的非常清楚, 教材由于删去了实验的 context, 这里也没法详细解释. 先标记出来, 看看需不需要为了照顾读者而补写一点.

**IMPLEMENTING PRACTICE VARIABILITY**

应用练习变异性

An important instruction planning decision is determining how to provide practice variability during practice sessions for learning a skill. The first step in making this decision is to assess the characteristics of the future situations in which the learner will perform a skill. Of particular relevance here are the *characteristics of the physical context* in which he or she will perform the skill and the *skill characteristics* that the performance situation will ­require. If you again view this situation as a transfer of learning situation, then you will see the value of using the test conditions to determine what the ­practice environment should be like. As we discussed in chapter 13 and illustrated in figure 13.1, effective transfer <u>is a function of</u> the similarities between skill, context, and cognitive processing characteristics of the practice and test situations. A high degree of similarity between these characteristics in the two situations enhances transfer between the practice and the test. 

在制定旨在学习某项技能的练习课的教学计划的过程中，十分重要的一步是决定如何在练习课上加入练习的变化。为了做出这一决定，首先要评估学习者未来执行该技能的环境具有怎样的情境特征。这里的情境特征主要是指技能表现所在环境的特征和表现情境要求的技能特征。如果从学习迁移的角度看，以测试情景为依据设置的练习情景是非常有价值的。如13章所述（详见表13.1），有效迁移与练习情境和测试情境间技能、情境和认知程序等特征的相似性<u>有关</u>。<font color='red'>[!! A is a function of B 基本都翻译为了 A 与 B 有关. 因为结合上下文这么翻是最顺的, 而且 function 也确实经常这么用, 比如 *Price is a function of supply and demand.* 如果不妥, 可以统一修改. ]</font> 两种情境的特征的高度相似有利于技能在各情境间的迁移。

**Varying Practice Contexts**

更改练习情境

<u>It is important to keep in mind that when people perform skills, they do so in contexts that have identifiable characteristics.</u> As we discussed in chapter 1 and as proposed by Gentile (2000), movements must directly conform to specific features of the environmental context (which she called regulatory conditions), whereas other features (nonregulatory conditions) have no influence or only an indirect influence on movement characteristics.

一提到人们在执行技能，就要想到他们是在有特定特征的情境中执行技能。<font color='red'>[!! 有比较的大的调整 但语义和原文应该是一样的 就是不能把 skill 和 context 割裂, 想到 skill 就要去想 context]</font>  Gentile（2000）指出（见第一章的讨论），某些情境特征会直接影响动作特征（她称之为调节条件），而另外一些特征（她称之为非调节条件）对动作特征没有或只有间接影响。

For example, some *regulatory conditions* that influence a person’s walking behavior are different when you walk on a concrete sidewalk than when you walk on ice or on sand. Also, you walk differently on a busy sidewalk that is cluttered with other people than on a sidewalk empty of people. When regulatory conditions like these may vary from one performance context to another, practice conditions should include a variety of similar ­conditions.

­举例来说，当你在水泥人行道上行走时，与在冰上或沙地上行走时，影响行走特征的某些调节条件是不同的。此外，即使都是在人行道上行走，在繁忙的人行道上与在没有人的人行道上，你的行走特征也是不同的。既然这样的调节条件可能随不同的表现情境而发生改变，我们也应该在练习情境中加入类似条件的变化。

*Nonregulatory conditions* for walking would include the physical environment around the walking pathway, such as buildings, trees, and open space as well as the sounds that are typically present in the environment. Although these features do not influence the movements directly, we know from our study of incidental memory in chapter 10 that they can influence the degree of success a person may achieve in carrying out the action in a unique context. Again, when nonregulatory conditions will vary from one performance context to another, practice conditions should provide opportunities to experience these characteristics.

还是拿行走来举例，非调节条件包括路径周围的物理环境，如建筑物、树木和空地，以及环境中一直存在的声音等。尽管这些特征不会直接影响动作特征，但从对无意识记忆的研究（见第10章）中得知，这些特征还是能影响一个人在特定情境中执行动作的成功程度。同样，既然非调节条件会随不同的表现情境发生改变，我们也应该在练习情境中加入类似条件的变化。

**Varying Practice Conditions for Closed Skills**

更改闭锁性技能的练习情景

As we discussed in chapter 1, closed skills can be sub-divided into whether or not the skill involves intertrial variability, which concerns the regulatory conditions remaining the same on the next trial (such as for shooting freethrows in basketball) or varying (such as for golf). The first step in making the decision about what to vary during the practice of a closed skill is to determine whether or not the skill involves intertrial variability for the regulatory conditions in the test situation. *For closed skills that do not involve intertrial variability of regulatory conditions,* such as competition darts, only the nonregulatory conditions may be novel. For the practice of these types of skills, regulatory conditions such as the distance to the target and the weight of the darts should remain constant (although there may be exceptions, but not varying regulatory conditions would be the first option to use), but nonregulatory conditions like the degree of lighting should vary according to expectations for the test situation. *For closed skills that involve intertrial variability,* both regulatory and nonregulatory conditions are likely to be novel in the test situation, which means that both should be varied in practice. Examples of practice condition characteristics for each of these types of closed skills are presented in table 16.1.

正如我们在第一章中所讨论的，闭锁性技能可以根据是否会发生尝试间变化进一步细分为在下一次试验中调节条件保持不变的技能（如篮球中的罚球）或调节条件发生改变的技能（如高尔夫球）。确定更改内容的第一步是判断该技能的调节条件是否会发生尝试间变化。对于前者，如竞赛飞镖，只有非调节条件可能会发生变化。对于这类型技能的练习来说，调节条件，如目标的距离和飞镖的重量都应该保持不变（虽然可能有例外，但不改变调节条件应该是首选）；而非调节条件，如照明亮度等应根据对测试情境的预判而进行改变。对于涉及尝试间变化的闭锁性技能，在测试时调节条件和非调节调节都可能发生改变，这意味着我们也应该在练习情景中同时加入这两者的变化。这类型闭锁性技能的练习条件的各种特征的实例见表16.1。

**Varying Practice Conditions for Open Skills**

更改开放性技能的练习情景

Each performance of an open skill is unique, because in each performance of the skill, certain characteristics of the movements must match the unique movements required by the regulatory conditions. That is, to perform the skill the person must produce certain movements that he or she has not made before in exactly the same manner this situation requires. The performer needs to modify previously produced movements in order to achieve the goal of the skill. For example, if you are preparing to return a serve in tennis, it is likely that certain characteristics of the ball action will be unique to this particular serve. Thus, in addition to variations of nonregulatory conditions, practice of open skills also needs to include a variety of experiences with regulatory conditions that change from one attempt to another.

开放性技能的每一次表现都是独一无二的，因为此类技能的表现情境在不断地变化，执行者必须根据调节条件的即时变化做出不同动作与之适应。也就是说，为了执行该技能，执行者必须做出完全符合这种情况所要求的动作，而这一动作他以前完全没有做过。为了达到这一目的，执行者需要更改以前执行的动作。比如，如果你准备在网球比赛中接住一个发球，球的某些动作特征就很可能是这个特定的发球所特有的。因此，除了要改变非调节条件，开放性技能的练习还需要让练习者体验到调节条件的各种变化。

**ORGANIZING VARIABLE PRACTICE**

组织变异练习

Because we know that experiencing practice variability benefits skill learning, it is important that we next consider how to organize the variable experiences within a practice session or unit of instruction. For example, suppose you are an elementary school physical education teacher organizing a teaching unit on throwing for your classes. You have determined that you will devote six class periods to this unit. You want the ­students to learn three variations of the throwing pattern: the overhand, underhand, and sidearm throws. The practice organization question for this situation is this: How should you arrange these three different throws for practice during the six class periods? Figure 16.2 shows three possible arrangements. One is to practice each throw in blocks of two days each (blocked practice). Another possibility is to practice each throw in a random arrangement with 5 min blocks devoted to each particular pattern (random practice). Thus, each day students would experience six 5 min blocks, with no specified order of occurrence for the three patterns; the only stipulation would be that they practice all three an equal amount over the course of the unit. The third arrangement, serial practice, also involves a 5 min block for each pattern. However, in this ­approach students practice each pattern for two sets of 5 min every day in the same order.

既然知道了练习的变异性有利于技能学习，接下来我们就要考虑如何在练习课或教学单元中组织练习的变化形式。假设你是一名小学体育教师，要为你的班级设计一个关于投掷的教学单元，并已确定要用6次课完成这个单元。你想让学生学习3种不同的投掷姿势：上手投掷、下手投掷和侧手投掷。那么，你应该如何在6个课时内安排这3种不同投掷姿势的练习呢？图16.2呈现了三种可能的安排方式。一种是分块练习每种投掷姿势，每块两天（分段练习）。另一种是随机安排每一种投掷姿势的练习，每一种投掷姿势都有5分钟的练习时间（随机练习）。这样，每天学生将进行6个5分钟的练习。三种姿势没有特定的出现顺序，唯一的要求是每种姿势的练习总时间应该相同。第三种安排方式也保证每一种投掷姿势都有5分钟的练习时间，只是会要求学生以相同的顺序练习每种姿势各两次（序列练习）。

This organization question is not unique to physical education. It applies to any situation in which learners must practice and learn several variations of a skill. Consider a few examples. In a therapy ­situation, a patient may need to practice grasping objects of different sizes, weights, and shapes. A patient who has had a knee joint replacement may need to practice walking on different types of ­surfaces. In a dance setting, a dancer may need to practice tempo variations in a routine or other variations of particular components of a routine. Each of these situations involves the same organization problem: How should the schedule of practice for these variations be organized within the practice time available?­­­­

这类组织问题不是体育教育所独有的，学习者学习和练习某一技能的多种变化形式时也会遇到这类问题。例如，在治疗情境中，病人可能需要练习抓取不同大小、重量和形状的物体。一个做了膝关节置换手术的病人可能需要练习在不同的路面上行走。在舞蹈情境中，一个舞者可能需要练习舞步节奏的变化的变化或舞步的特定组成部分的其他变化。这些情境都涉及到了同样的组织问题：如何在现有的练习时间内组织练习这些变化形式？

**The Contextual Interference Approach to Organizing Variable Practice**

用背景干扰法组织变异练习

One answer to the variable practice schedule question is to apply the learning phenomenon known as the *contextual interference effect.* William Battig (1979), who first demonstrated this effect, introduced the term **contextual interference** to refer to the *interference* (recall the definition and use of this term in chapter 10 in our discussion of influences on forgetting in memory) that results from performing various tasks or skills within the *context* of practice. This means that practice sessions can include experiences that disrupt memory while practicing a skill or skills.

组织变异练习的一种方法是应用被称作*背景干扰效应*的学习现象。William Battig（1979）首次论证并引入了术语“背景干扰”来指代这种效应。所谓“背景干扰”指的是在练习情境中执行不同的任务和技能可以产生*干扰*（关于这个术语的定义和用法见10章关于记忆遗忘的影响因素的有关讨论）。<u>这意味着旨在练习一种或几种技能的练习课也会对记忆产生干扰。</u> <font color='red'>[!! 调整较大]</font>

The way a practice schedule is organized will involve different amounts of contextual interference. The blocked, random, and serial practice schedule organization options described earlier, each represent different amounts of contextual interference, which can be viewed as located along a continuum of the amount of contextual interference (see figure 16.3). A *high amount of contextual interference* occurs at one extreme, when the practice schedule involves a random arrangement of trials so that all the task variations are performed in each practice session. In this schedule, the task variation ­practiced on each trial would be randomly determined. At the opposite extreme, a *low amount of contextual interference* results from a schedule that organizes the practice of each task variation in its own block, or unit, of time. Other schedules, such as the serial schedule described earlier, fall along the continuum between these two extremes. It is important to note here that the different types of practice schedules can be based on trials, as they are in figure 16.3, or on time intervals. For developing practice schedules associated with contextual interference either trials or time intervals are appropriate.

练习计划的不同组织方式都对应着数量不等的情境干扰。前面提到的分块练习、随机练习和序列练习各自代表了不同的背景干扰量，可以视为是背景干扰量连续区间上的不同点（见图16.3）。区间的一个端点对应着随机练习法，此时背景干扰量最多，一次课上要练习所有的变化形式。区间的另一个端点对应的是分块练习法，此时背景干扰量最少，每个时间块要练习什么早已被确定好。其他的安排方式，如前面提到的序列练习法，都位于这两个端点之间。值得一提的是，这里的练习计划可以基于试验（如图16.3所示），也可以基于时间间隔。对于制定与背景干扰有关的练习计划来说，无论是基于试验还是基于时间间隔都是合适的。

­The **contextual interference effect** occurs when *a high amount of contextual interference results in better learning* (i.e., retention and transfer perfor­mance) of the task variations than a low amount. What is especially noteworthy about this effect is that prior to Battig’s initial demonstration of it, ­researchers ­traditionally viewed interference as something that hinders learning. According to that view, a low amount of contextual interference during practice should lead to better learning than a high amount. However, Battig’s research showed an important exception to the traditional view of interference. It is important to note in this regard that a negative influence of interference is often found for high contextual interference schedules during practice. But this interference turns out to benefit learning because the high contextual interference practice schedules result in better performance on retention and transfer tests than low contextual ­interference practice schedules.

当背景干扰多的练习计划产生的学习效果（即保留测试和迁移测试的表现）比背景干扰少的练习计划要更好时，就可以说出现了背景干扰效应。值得一提的是，在 Battig 证明这个效应之前，研究人员一般都认为干扰会阻碍学习。根据这一观点，在练习过程中，背景干扰少的练习计划产生的学习效果应该比背景干扰多的练习计划要更好。然而，Battig 的研究却与这一传统观点截然不同。有必要指出的是，大量背景干扰往往确实会对练习过程产生负面影响。但是，这种干扰最终是有利于学习的，因为高背景干扰的练习者相比于低背景干扰的练习者在保留测试和迁移测试中的表现更好。

The first evidence of the contextual interference ­effect for motor skill learning was reported by Shea and Morgan (1979). Participants practiced three variations of movement patterns in which the goal was to move one arm through a series of small wooden barriers as rapidly as possible. One group followed a blocked practice schedule (i.e., low contextual interference) in which each movement pattern was practiced in its own unit of trials. A second group practiced according to a random schedule (i.e., high contextual interference) in which the practice of each pattern was randomly distributed throughout the practice trials. An important point here is that both groups practiced for the same number of trials, only the scheduling of trials differed.

Shea 和 Morgan （1979）首次报告了运动技能学习中的背景干扰效应。被试者要练习使一只手臂以最快的速度通过一连串小的木质障碍，练习包括了动作的三种变化形式。一组人采用低背景环境干扰的分段练习法进行练习，动作的每种变化形式都在单独的时间单元内练习。第二组采用高背景干扰的随机练习法进行练习，动作的每种变化形式都随机地分布在练习的各个阶段中。两组的练习次数相同，只是练习的时间安排不同。

­Results showed that the random practice schedule led to poorer performance during practice, but better performance on retention and transfer tests. Thus, random practice resulted in better learning of the three pattern variations and allowed for better performance for a new pattern. Since the Shea and Morgan ­experiment, numerous other studies have been reported (see Brady, 1998; Lee, 2012; Magill & Hall, 1990; Pauwels, Swinnen, & Beets, 2014). The evidence from this research establishes that the contextual interference effect is generalizable to learning ­motor skills.

结果表明，随机练习组在练习期间的表现较差，但在保留测试和转移测试中却有较好表现。也就是说，用随机练习法的练习者的学习效果更好，并且也能更好掌握新的变化形式。继 Shea 和 Morgan 的实验之后，已经有许多其他的研究报告（见 Brady, 1998; Lee, 2012; Magill & Hall, 1990; Pauwels, Swinnen, & Beets, 2014）证明背景干扰效应对运动技能的学习有正面效果。

One of the striking negative effects of low contextual interference practice is that it inhibits ­performance of the practiced skills in novel performance contexts. Contextual interference experiments commonly show this. Although blocked practice sometimes leads to blocked retention test performance that is similar to performance following random practice, a large decrement in retention performance is typical when researchers test the skills <u>under random conditions</u> (e.g., Shea, Kohl, & Indermill, 1990). On the other hand, high contextual interference practice does not show the same transfer problem. Thus, low contextual interference practice appears to develop a practice context dependency that decreases a person’s capability to adapt to novel test contexts.

­低背景干扰练习有一个显著的负面影响，就是会抑制练习者在技能新变化形式下的表现。这一点已被许多研究背景干扰的实验证明。此外，尽管有时采用分段练习的练习者在固定顺序的迁移测试中的成绩与采用随机练习的练习者相仿，<u>但一旦研究人员将测试顺序改为随机时</u><font color='red'>[!! 我查了原始文献, 这里 random conditions 指的仅仅是在测试的时候使用随机顺序而不是什么"在随机条件下测试"]</font>，保留测试成绩往往会大幅下降（例如，Shea, Kohl, & Indermill, 1990）。然而，高背景干扰练习就不会有这种迁移问题。因此，低背景干扰练习似乎让练习者对练习情境产生依赖，降低了他适应新测试情境的能力。

***The contextual interference effect outside the ­laboratory.*** Battig’s original demonstration of the contextual interference effect was based on the learning of cognitive skills, such as word lists. Much of the research involving motor skills has been based on the learning of laboratory tasks, such as the barrier-knockdown task used by Shea and Morgan (1979). If we want to have confidence in the application of laboratory-based principles of motor learning to real-world contexts, it is important to establish that learning phenomena demonstrated in the laboratory also exist in real-world settings. We will look at a few examples of research that provide evidence that the contextual interference effect occurs in learning situations outside the ­laboratory.

***实验室以外的情境干扰效应***。Battig 一开始对背景干扰效应的论证都是以对认知技能（如记忆单词表）学习的研究为基础的。而许多涉及运动技能的研究采用的都是实验室中的任务 ，比如 Shea 和Morgan（1979）使用的障碍拆卸任务。如果我们想确认从实验室中总结出的运动学习原则对现实世界也有指导作用，那我们就必须确定在实验室中的学习现象在现实世界中也同样存在。下面我们就来介绍一些实验室之外的背景干扰效应的研究。

­One of the first experiments that presented this type of evidence was reported by Goode and ­Magill (1986). College women with no prior badminton experience practiced the short, long, and drive serves from the right service court. They practiced these serves three days a week for three weeks with 36 trials in each practice session, for a total of 324 trials (108 trials per serve) during the practice ­period. The low contextual interference condition was a modification of the blocked condition used in previous studies; in this study, the blocked practice group practiced one serve each day of each week. The group on a random practice schedule practiced each serve randomly in every practice session. In this condition, the experimenter told each participant which serve she should perform next.

Goode 和 ­Magill（1986年）最早进行了这类实验以提供背景干扰效应在实验室之外也有用的证据。他们选取没有羽毛球经验的女大学生在右侧发球区练习三种发球方式：短球、长球、和大力发球。练习为期三周，每周练习三次，每次练习又包括36次尝试，因此在整个练习阶段共有324次（每种姿势各108次）的发球练习。其中低背景干扰组的练习方式是分段练习法的变体，即每周只练习一种发球。随机练习组则在每次练习中随机选择发球的姿势，由实验人员在练习开始前告知被试者具体的发球的姿势。

As you can see in figure 16.4, the results demonstrated the contextual interference effect. The group that practiced with the random schedule outperformed the blocked practice group on the retention and transfer tests. What is especially remarkable is that on the transfer test, which involved serving from the left service court, the random group showed no deterioration in performance. On the other hand, students in the group that had practiced in a blocked schedule were not able to adapt well to this new performance context. In fact, learners in this group performed in the new context about as well as they had when they had begun practicing the serves from the right court three weeks earlier.

正如图16.4所示，实验结果证明了背景干扰效应的存在。在保留测试和转移测试中，随机实验组的表现都优于分段实验组。尤其值得注意的是，在改从左侧发球区发球的迁移测试中，随机练习组的表现没有下降。然而，分段练习组就不能很好地适应这种新的表现情境。这组被试者在新情境下的表现与他们三周前刚开始练习从右侧发球区发球时的差不多。

A study by a group of researchers in Greece (Tsopani, Dallas, Tasika, & Tinto, 2012) showed the contextual interference effect for novice university female rhythmic gymnasts. The study compared two practice schedules. One involved the traditional blocked practice approach (traditionally used by the university training program), which had gymnasts practice all the trials for one apparatus before beginning practice on another apparatus. The other schedule required the gymnasts to follow a serial-type schedule in which they practiced trials for each apparatus in a specified sequence in each practice session. On a retention test following the nine weeks of practice sessions (two 90-min. sessions per week), all the participants were judged on their technical and artistry performance on each apparatus. Results showed that the gymnasts who followed the serial-practice scheduled performed at a higher level than those who used the traditional blocked schedule. The two studies just discussed showed the benefit of high contextual interference for *beginners* learning actual sport skills (three badminton serves and several rhythmic gymnastics skills). However, although their experiments used sport skills, the authors carried them out in controlled experimental conditions. Those who seek even more real-world validity should note that Wrisberg and Liu (1991) attained the same results as Goode and Magill, but in an actual class setting. In that study, students learned the badminton serves in a unit of instruction in an actual physical education class.

希腊的一组研究人员（Tsopani, Dallas, Tasika, & Tinto, 2012）则是在一群大学女子艺术体操初学者身上证明了背景干扰效应。这项研究比较了传统的分段练习法和序列练习法对学习效果的影响。分段练习法（也是那所大学一贯采用的练习法）让体操运动员们在完成某个器械的全部练习之后才去练习下一个器械。而序列练习法则是让体操运动员们在练习课上按照按指定的顺序练习依次练习每种器械。练习共持续9周，每周两节90分钟的练习课。在这之后，实验人员对所有体操运动员进行了迁移测试，从技术性和艺术性两方面进行打分。实验结果表明，采用序列练习法的体操运动员比采用分段练习法的体操运动员表现得更好。上述的两项研究足以表明高背景干扰帮助初学者学习运动技能（如三种羽毛球发球方式以及几种艺术体操技能）。不过虽然这些研究都用的是现实中的运动技能，但毕竟还是在受控的实验情境下进行的。如果你希望看到更多关于背景干扰效应在现实世界的有效性的讨论，可以去阅读 Wrisberg 和 Liu （1991）。在这项研究中，学生们在一个实际的体育课的教学单元中学习羽毛球发球。最终他们在实际的课堂情境中得到的结果与 Goode 和 ­Magill 一致。

Another experiment worth noting demonstrates that the contextual interference effect for real-world skills exists not only for beginners, but also for *skilled individuals.* Hall, Domingues, and 
Cavazos (1994) had skilled baseball players ­practice hitting different types of pitches to improve their batting performance. The players engaged in forty-five extra pitches of batting practice three days a week for five weeks. Batters hit fastballs, curves, or change-ups according to a blocked or random schedule. In the blocked schedule, players practiced hitting one of these pitches on each day, whereas in the random schedule, they hit all three types of pitch, randomly presented, each day. The results showed that on a test involving a random sequence of pitches, like one that would occur in a game, players who had experienced the random practice schedule performed better than those who had practiced according to the blocked schedule.

Hall，Domingues和 Cavazos（1994）的研究则是证明在现实世界中，背景干扰效应不仅对初学者起效，对*熟练的运动员*也同样有帮助。他们让熟练的棒球运动员练习击打不同类型的球以提高击球表现。在为期五周的练习中，运动员们每周有三天进行45次附加的击球练习。击球手要练习打出快速球、曲线球和变化球。练习计划分为分段练习和随机练习两种。分段练习组的运动员每天只练习击打一种类型的球，而随机练习组的运动员每天则会随机的击打三种类型的球。在一项依比赛情境设计的乱序击球测试中，采用随机练习法的运动员比采用分段练习法的体操运动员表现得更好。

In addition to these few examples, several other studies have found evidence that demonstrates the contextual interference effect for the learning of real-world skills. These include basketball shooting skills, tennis groundstrokes, volleyball serves, rifle shooting, knot tying, handwriting skills, chiropractic spine manipulation, and computer game skills (see Brady, 1998; Enebo & Sherwood, 2005; Ollis, Button, & Fairweather 2005; Ste-Marie, Clark, Findlay, & Latimer, 2004, for discussions of the various studies involving these skills). The contextual interference effect has also been found for the learning of perceptual-cognitive skills that underlie anticipation and decision making in sports (e.g., Broadbent, Causer, Ford, & Williams, 2015; Broadbent, Causer, Williams, & Ford, 2017). When considered together with the research based on laboratory tasks, research involving real-world skills establishes the contextual interference effect as an important motor learning phenomenon.

除了这些研究，还有许多其他的研究也证明在现实世界的技能学习中存在背景干扰效应，这些技能包括篮球投篮、网球回球、排球发球、步枪射击、绳结绑系、文字书写、脊椎按摩以及电子游戏等（关于上述技能的研究，见 Brady, 1998; Enebo & Sherwood, 2005; Ollis, Button, & Fairweather 2005; Ste-Marie, Clark, Findlay, & Latimer, 2004）。背景干扰效应在知觉-认知技能的学习过程中也有体现，这类技能是体育运动中预判和决策的基础。以上对现实世界的技能学习的研究结合对实验室任务的研究，可以确定背景干扰效应确实是一种重要的运动学习现象。

**Contextual Interference Influences Judgments about Learning**

背景干扰影响了对学习的判断

In chapter 11, you saw some examples of situations in which performance during practice misrepresents the amount of learning occurring during practice. The contextual interference effect is another example of this type of situation. In fact, not only does practice performance misrepresent the amount of learning, it also influences the learners’ judgments about how much they are learning depending on which practice schedule they experienced. Judgment about how much we are learning while we practice is referred to as *metacognition,* which concerns “what we know about what we know.” The assessment of this information is typically done by asking people to predict how well they think they will do on a ­retention test. A study by Simon and Bjork (2001) demonstrated that people who used a blocked schedule for practicing three goal movement times and patterns of a five-key sequence of numbers on a computer number pad consistently overestimated their performance on a test that would occur the next day. In contrast, participants who followed a random practice schedule more accurately estimated their test performance (see figure 16.5).

­第11章中的一些例子表明练习中的表现会让我们错误估计练习过程中的习得量。背景干扰效应则是这一情况的又一实例。实际上，练习中的表现不仅会导致对习得量的误判，而且还会影响学习者根据练习计划判断自己的习得量。判断自己习得量的过程被称为*元认知*，涉及到“对我们所了解的东西的了解”。评估这一信息的通常方法是要求人们预测自己在保留测试中的表现。在 Simon 和 Bjork（2001）的一项研究中，被试者要练习在数字键盘上以一定的顺序按下五个键。共有三种不同的按键序列，每种顺序的目标用时也不同。研究表明，分段练习组的被试者总是会高估他们在第二天的测试中的表现。相比之下，随机练习组的练习者对测试成绩的估计则更加准确（见图16.5）。<font color='red'>[!! 本段参考原始文献进行了一定程度的改写]</font>

Why would this type of overestimation of learning occur for the blocked practice schedule? The most likely reason is that because people perform relatively well using this schedule they use their level of performance during practice as the basis for predicting how well they will perform the next day. But because they are not learning as much as their performance would indicate, they do not perform the next day as well as they expected because the contextual interference effect influenced their learning during practice.

为什么采用分段练习组的被试者总是会高估他们的表现？最有可能的原因是他们会根据练习时的表现水平来预测第二天表现，而在分段练习中他们的表现相对较好。但是，由于他们的习得量并不像表现出来的那么多，所以第二天的表现并不会像他们预期的那样好，因为情境干扰效应影响了他们在练习中的学习效果。

**What Are the Limits of the Contextual Interference Effect?**

背景干扰效应的局限性是什么？

Although researchers have provided a large amount of evidence supporting the existence of the contextual interference effect, they also have shown that it does not apply to all motor skill learning situations. As a result, a question arises concerning the characteristics that limit the generalization of the effect, which concerns how broadly the effect can be applied. Both task and learner characteristics have been the focus of speculations and investigations of this issue.

尽管已有大量证据证明背景干扰效应有益于学习，但该效应并不是适用于所有的技能学习情境。因此，为了了解该效应的应用范围有多广出现了，就有必要探讨到底是哪些因素限制了背景干扰效应发挥作用。到目前为止，这个问题的研究重点在于运动技能的特征和学习者的特征。<font color='red'>[!! 为突出主题, 对句式进行了比较大的调整]</font>

***Motor skill characteristics.*** In the first comprehensive review of the research literature, Magill and Hall (1990) hypothesized that the ­contextual interference effect would more likely be found for motor skill variations controlled by different  generalized motor programs (discussed in chapter 5) than by the same program. For example, when a person practices learn­ing several skill variations characterized by different relative time ­patterns, such as would be expected for the three badminton serves described earlier, a high ­contextual interference practice schedule should lead to better learning than a low contextual interference schedule. However, when the skill variations are characterized by the same relative time patterns, but different overall speeds, there should be no advantage to a high over a low contextual interference practice schedule. When removed from the context of the generalized motor program, the Magill and Hall hypothesis proposed that for the learning of skill variations, the contextual interference effect should be found when the characteristics of the variations are more dissimilar than similar.

­***运动技能特征*** 在最早的文献综述中，Magill 和 Hall （1990）认为不同类型的一般运动程序（见第5章）较同类的一般动作程序更容易产生背景干扰效应。例如，当一个人要练习相对时间不同的几种技能的变化形式（如前面提到的三种羽毛球发球方式）时，高背景干扰练习的学习效果应该好于低背景干扰的练习。然而，如果是相对时间模式保持不变，但总体速度变化，高背景干扰练习相比低情境干扰练习就没什么优势了。如果不考虑一般运动程序，Magill 和 Hall 的假设认为，对于技能变化形式的学习，这些变化形式彼此之间的差异越大，就越容易出现背景干扰效应。<font color='red'>[!! 有点没看懂，不确定“When removed from the context of the generalized motor program”是不是这个意思]</font>

Another possible reason for the limited generalization of the effect was presented by Brady (1998). In his assessment of the research that investigated the contextual interference effect, Brady concluded that research involving laboratory tasks tends to support the hypothesis (e.g., Wood & Ging, 1991; Wulf & Lee, 1993). But when research involves applied settings, higher amounts of contextual interference tend to enhance the learning of skill variations that are more similar than different (also see Barreiros, Figueiredo, & Godinho, 2007, and Merbah & Meulemans, 2011). For example, compared to a low contextual interference practice schedule, moderate and high contextual interference practice schedules produced better learning of one-hand basketball set shots from different distances and angles (Landin & Hebert, 1997), but not better learning of three different volleyball skills (French, Rink, & Werner, 1990).

Brady （1998）在相关研究的评价中认为，对实验室任务的研究倾向于支持这一假设（例如，Wood & Ging, 1991; Wulf & Lee, 1993）。但是在应用条件下，反而是几种技能变化形式越相似（而不是越不同），较高的背景干扰越能起到增强作用<font color='red'>[!! 英文表达很简练, 中文表达就麻烦了, 这一句也改动的比较大, 希望没有脱离原意]</font>（也见Barreiros, Figueiredo, & Godinho, 2007, and Merbah & Meulemans, 2011）。例如，在不同距离和角度的单手篮球定点投篮学习中，中等水平和高水平的背景干扰相比低水平的背景干扰产生了更好的学习效果（Landin & Hebert, 1997），但在三种不同的排球技能的学习中则没有产生更好的效果（French, Rink, & Werner, 1990）。

Two reasons may account for this discrepancy between the laboratory and applied settings. First, the learning of sport skills requires more practice than has been included in those studies that have not found the effect. Because sport skills tend to be more complex and difficult than the typical laboratory skills used in contextual interference research, much more practice would be required to learn the sport skills. The second reason is that sport skills may have unique characteristics that may require a practice schedule that increases contextual interference, such as a progression of low to high amounts of contextual interference (see Porter, 2008; Porter & Magill, 2010). Unfortunately, these two possibilities remain speculative until we have a sufficient amount of research evidence that either supports or does not support them. However it is noteworthy that Saemi and colleagues (2012) reported a learning benefit for elementary school children in physical education classes who experienced a progressive low-to-high contextual interference practice schedule.

有两个原因可以解释在实验室和应用条件下研究结果差异。首先，体育技能的学习需要更多的练习，因为体育技能往往比实验室技能更加复杂和困难。而在那些报告不存在背景干扰效应的研究中，练习时间是不够的。<font color='red'>[!! 大幅调整了句子结构, 删去了一些冗余的分句]</font>第二个原因是，运动技能可能有一些独特的特征，而这些特征可能需要的是一个背景干扰的不断增加练习计划，例如由低到高增加背景干扰（见Porter, 2008; Porter & Magill, 2010）。然而，在我们有足够多的研究证据之前，这些仍然都只是推测。不过值得一提的是，Saemi 及其同事（2012）报告，在体育课上，从低到高的渐进式背景干扰练习有助于小学生的学习。 

***Learner characteristics.*** Researchers have also proposed that several *learner characteristics* may limit the effect of contextual interference on skill learning. Of the characteristics suggested, *age and skill level* appear to be the most likely limiting ­factors. When participants in studies have been children, the highest amounts of contextual interference typically do not enhance learning (e.g., Graser, Bastiaenen, & Hedel, 2019). In fact, Brady’s (1998) review points out that for children, practice schedules that produce lower amounts of contextual interference tend to produce better learning. However, as noted above, learning benefits for children were reported by Saemi et al. (2012) when they practiced physical education skills using a progressive low-to-high contextual interference schedule, <u>which emphasizes a low amount of contextual interference early in practice.</u> In terms of skill level, Hebert, Landin, and Solmon (1996) found that low-skilled students in university tennis classes performed forehand and backhand strokes better on a retention test following blocked practice, whereas high-skilled students performed no differently following blocked or ­alternating-trials practice schedules.

­­***学习者的特征***。研究人员还提出学习者的一些特征也会影响背景干扰效应在技能学习中的应用。在所有特征中，*年龄*和*技能水平*是最有可能的两个。研究表明高背景干扰一般来说不会提高年幼被试者学习效果（例如，Graser, Bastiaenen, & Hedel, 2019）。实际上， Brady（1988）在研究中已经指出。对于儿童来说，低背景干扰的练习计划往往会更有效。但是，如上所述， Saemi 等人（2012）的研究表明从低到高渐近式的安排练习计划会有助于儿童的学习。<u>注意这里强调的是低背景干扰在练习早期的作用。</u><font color='red'>[!! 上一句才说 Brady 认为低背景干扰对儿童学习有帮助, 而 Saemi 的实验实际上对 Brady 的结论进行了更精细的阐发, 表明低背景干扰实际上是对早期练习有效( Brady 直接归因于"儿童", 没有想到是"练习早期"). 这个分句实际上就起到了这么一个递进的作用, 但直译为中文后感觉就没有英文连贯了, 也没法很好地表述出原文那种递进的感觉, 所以先标记一下, 看看有没有更好的翻译]</font>在技能水平方面，Hebert、Landin和Solmon（1996）发现，在大学网球班里，技能水平低的学生进行分段练习后，正手和反手击球的保留测试成绩得到了提高，而技能水平高的学生无论是结束分段练习还是交替练习，成绩都没有变化。

In summary, we know that certain factors limit the extent of the generalization of the contextual interference effect in motor skill learning situations. Unfortunately, we do not have a definitive account of the specific characteristics that establish those limits. Although there is general agreement that both task- and learner-related characteristics influence the degree to which contextual interference ­influences the learning of motor skill variations, we must wait for much more research evidence to allow us to confidently identify the specific characteristics.

­综上所述，我们知道存在某些因素导致背景干扰效应在运动技能学习情境中的应用范围有限。不幸的是，我们还无法确切说明到底是哪些因素其了限制作用。尽管人们普遍认为，背景干扰效应能对运动技能的变化形式的学习起到多大作用，一定程度上取决于任务特征和学习者的特征，但我们仍需更多研究来去明确这些具体的特征。

A different but encouraging perspective on the influence of task- and learner-related characteristics on learning was presented by Guadagnoli and Lee (2004). They proposed a *challenge point hypothesis* for determining effective practice conditions based on difficulty characteristics of the tasks and the skill level of the person. The “challenge point” refers to the implementation of specific practice conditions that will optimally challenge the person in a way that will enhance skill learning. Determining the challenge point involves a consideration of both the difficulty level of the skill being learned and the skill level of the learner. There are two types of “task difficulty” here: (1) “nominal,” which is task specific and refers to the inherent perceptual and motor requirements of the task (such as were considered in our discussion in chapter 1 of ­Gentile’s Taxonomy of Skills); (2) “functional,” which is related to the skill level of the person (i.e., some skills are less difficult for a skilled person to perform than for a novice). The hypothesis makes two predictions concerning the implementation of levels of contextual interference in practice schedules. First, higher levels of contextual interference will be optimal for learning skills with the lowest levels of difficulty, but less optimal for skills with the highest levels of difficulty. ­Second, for beginners, or those with low skill levels, lower levels of contextual interference will be optimal; while higher levels of contextual interference will be more effective for more skilled individuals. Although these predictions fit the model the authors created, we need empirical evidence to determine how well they apply to specific motor skill learning situations.

­­Guadagnoli 和 Lee（2004）对上述问题的观点与众不同却又引人深思。他们就任务特征与学习者特征对学习的影响提出了“挑战点假说”。这一假说可以通过任务难度和练习者的技能水平来确定最有效的练习情境。这里“挑战点”指的是一个对学习者来说具有挑战性的练习情境，可以恰到好处地提高技能学习的效果。为了确定挑战点，需要综合考量所学技能的难度和学习者的技能水平。假说里的“任务难度”分为两种：（1）“客观难度”，这指的是任务本身的难度，和任务本身的知觉要求和运动要求有关（比如第一章 Gentile 的技能分类法所考虑的那些）；（2）"主观难度"，这与学习者的技能水平有关（也就是说，有些任务初学者觉得难，熟练者则觉得没那么难）。该假说对背景干扰效应在练习安排中的效果做出了两个预测。首先，较高的背景干扰有助于学习难度最低的技能，但对于难度最高的技能来说就不那么适用了。其次，对于初学者或低技能水平的人来说，较低的背景干扰最有助于学习；而对更熟练的人来说，较高的背景干扰对他们将更有效。尽管这些预测符合作者建立的模型，但我们需要经验证据来确定它们在具体运动技能学习情境下的适用性。

**Implications for the Practitioner**

练习组织者要注意的事项

Given the inconclusive nature of our present knowledge about the specific factors that limit the generalization of the effect of contextual interference on skill learning, what should the practitioner do? To answer this, refer to figure 16.3. It is important to keep in mind that our present knowledge is different for the top and bottom portions of the continuum in this figure. In terms of the top half, we know that moderate and high amounts of contextual interference generally produce better learning of skill variations than low amounts. <u>However, the bottom half of the figure remains unresolved in terms of the amount of contextual interference specific ­practice schedules produce when they are used for the ­learning of specific skill variations.</u> As a result, view the continuum in figure 16.3 as representing a generic relationship between the various practice schedules and the amount of contextual interference each produces.

­­鉴于我们目前尚未完全探明限制背景干扰对技能学习发挥作用的具体因素，练习组织者应该怎么做？要回答这个问题，还必须回到图16.3。需要认识到，我们现有的认识与图中所示的连续区间所要说明的问题还是存在差异的。从背景干扰高的那一端可知学习者在中高背景干扰下一般能取得比低背景干扰更好的学习效果。<u>但是从低的那一端看，按照表上所示的练习计划能否在特定的技能学习中产生低水平的背景干扰还是存疑的。</u><font color='red'>[!! 有点迷惑, 首先全文一直都给我一种"分段练习就是低背景干扰, 随机练习就是高背景干扰"的影响, 不知道这里怎么突然说这个关系是不一定的. 而且这个however和上文也没有直接的转折关系(上文说的是高背景干扰有益于学习, 而不是"随机练习一定产生高背景干扰")], 可能我理解有误, 先标记一下]</font>因此，只能把图16.3所示的连续区间看作不同的练习计划与背景干扰量直接的一般性关系，而不是确定性的关系。

*For the practitioner,* when several variations of a skill must be learned, the best course of action is to select a practice schedule that should produce a moderate to high amount of contextual interference (according to figure 16.3). But he or she should be prepared to modify the schedule after practice begins in order to accommodate individuals who do not respond well to the practice schedule. For example, some individuals may require a practice schedule that produces a lower amount of contextual interference, such as a blocked schedule, until they acquire the basic movement patterns of the skill variations. However, it is important that the practitioner base any practice schedule modification on performance difficulties evident from retention or transfer tests rather than on those from practice sessions.

对练习组织者来说，当要让学习者学习一项技能的多种变化形式时，最好选择一个包括中等水平到高等水平的练习计划（依图16.3）。但在练习开始后，组织者也要准备好为那些不能很好适应当前练习计划的个人调整练习计划。例如，有些人可能在习得该技能变化形式的基础动作以前都需要低背景干扰练习。不过十分重要的一点是，组织者应该依照练习者在保留测试或迁移测试上表现出的明显困难而不是在练习过程中表现出的明显困难来调整练习计划。

**ACCOUNTING FOR THE CONTEXTUAL INTERFERENCE EFFECT**

背景干扰效应的解释

An important question that remains unanswered is this: Why does the contextual interference effect occur? Two hypotheses predominate the several accounts for this effect. One is the *elaboration hypothesis;* the other is known as the *action plan reconstruction hypothesis.* We will consider each briefly in the following sections.

现在还有一个悬而未决的问题是：为什么会出现背景干扰效应？在众多试图回答该问题的假说中，有两种假说占据了主导地位：一个是 *精细加工假说*，另一个是<u>动作计划重建假设</u><font color='red'>[!! 待确定的术语]</font>。我们将在下面的章节对这两种假说进行一下简要的讨论。

**The Elaboration Hypothesis**

精细加工假说

In the experiment that first showed the contextual interference effect for learning motor skills, Shea and Morgan (1979) proposed that the effect is ­related to the *elaboration of the memory representation* of each of the skill variations that a learner is practicing.
During random practice, a person engages in more memory storage and retrieval-related strategies, as well as more different strategies, than an individual who practices according to a blocked schedule. Also, because in a random practice schedule the person retains in working memory all the skill variations he or she is practicing, the person can compare and contrast the variations so that each becomes distinct from the other. The ­result of engaging in these cognitive activities during practice is that the learner develops and stores a more elaborate memory representation for the skills that he or she then can access more readily during a test.

在首次显示运动技能学习中背景干扰效应的实验中，Shea 和Morgan（1979）提出，这种效应与学习者正在练习的技能变化形式的记忆表征的精细加工有关。­随机练习的学习者相比分段练习的练习者采取了更多的策略。这些策略包含记忆储存和检索相关策略，以及更多其他的策略。另外，由于采用随机练习，学习者会在工作记忆中保留了他正在练习的所有的技能变化形式，因此学习者可以比较和对比这些变化形式，由此发掘出每个变化形式所具有的独特特征。正是因为在练习过程中进行了这些认知活动，学习者建立并储存了一个更复杂的技能记忆表征，这些记忆表征在测试中也更容易被回忆。

**The Action Plan Reconstruction Hypothesis**

行动计划重建假说

An alternative hypothesis, by Lee and Magill (1985), stated that high amounts of contextual interference benefit learning because the interference requires a person to more actively reconstruct an action plan on the next practice trial for a ­particular skill variation. This reconstruction is necessary because the person has partially or completely forgotten the action plan he or she developed for the previous practice trial for that skill variation. The forgetting was due to the interference caused by the ­intervening practice trials of the other skill variations. In contrast, the person following a blocked practice schedule can use the same or slightly alter the action plan he or she used on the previous trial.

另一个由 ­­Lee 和 Magill （1985）提出的假说认为，之所以高背景干扰有利于学习，是因为干扰迫使练习者在下一次练习特定的技能变化形式时更主动地去重建<u>动作计划</u><font color='red'>[!! 直译略怪异, 或许"动作方式"更好? 这里的 *action plan* 我理解就是 *a set of things to do in order to achieve action goal*  , 用"计划"感觉不是很好]</font>。考虑到练习者已经部分或全部遗忘了上一次练习这个变化形式时建立起来的动作计划，这种重建是很有必要的。会遗忘是因为由其他技能变化形式的练习造成了干扰。相比之下，分段练习的学习者在练习中可以完全照搬或者只是微调上一次练习中采用的动作计划。

The following example illustrates how these different practice schedules would require different types of action plan activity. If you must add a long set of numbers and then you are immediately asked to do the same problem again, you probably will not re-add the numbers, but will simply remember and ­repeat only the answer. But, if your addition task requires you to add several additional lists of numbers before you are given the first list again, you probably will have forgotten the solution to that problem and therefore will have to add the same numbers again. The <u>intervening</u> problem-solving activity requires you to re-solve a problem you have solved already.

­下面的例子解释了为什么不同的练习方式会改变练习者处理动作计划的方式。如果一个人做完一长串数字的加法后，马上要求他再做一遍一模一样的事，那么他大概率不会把相同的数字再重加一遍，而是直接记住然后重述刚才的答案。但是如果在做完几组不同的加法题后再让他去做第一次做的题，他也许就会因为忘了答案而不得不重新加一次。也就是说，这种<u>插入式</u><font color='red'>[!! 我知道这里 *intervening* 的意思是"会带来干扰的", 但这层意思不好翻译, 干脆就直译了]</font>的解题活动会使得练习者重新解决他已经解决过的问题。

Lee and Magill hypothesized that the high contextual interference practice condition is like the addition situation in which there are several other problems to solve before you see the first problem again. When a learner practices a motor skill, the interference created by the practice trials between two trials of the same skill variation causes the person to forget much of the action plan he or she ­developed for the first trial. As a result, the learner must reconstruct and modify that plan to attempt the skill on the next trial. On the other hand, the blocked practice schedule is like the addition problem in which the next trial follows immediately, and it is easy to remember the solution and therefore be successful on the next trial.

Lee 和 Magill 的假设认为，高背景干扰练习就像做完几组不同的加法题后再去做第一次的题。当学习者练习一项运动技能时，在同一技能变化形式的两次尝试之间的练习所产生的干扰会使人忘记他在第一次尝试中所确定的动作计划的大部分内容。因此，学习者必须重新构建和修改该动作计划，以便在下一次尝试中表现该技能。而分段练习就像做完后马上再重复一遍的加法题，很容易通过记住解决方案的方式在下一次尝试中成功表现。

In the motor learning context, *high contextual interference conditions require learners to engage more actively in problem-solving activity* during practice. Although this activity typically leads learners to perform more poorly during practice than they would with a low contextual interference schedule, this short-term performance deficit ­becomes a long-term benefit, because it leads to better retention and transfer test performance.

­在运动学习方面，高情境干扰条件要求学习者在练习中更积极地参与解决问题的活动。尽管这种活动通常会导致学习者在练习中的表现比在低情境干扰条件下的表现更差，但这种短期的表现缺陷长期来看会是一种好处，因为它将带来更好的保留和转移测试表现。

**Research Supports Both Hypotheses**

研究支持两种假设

Much research is needed to determine which of the two hypotheses best accounts for the contextual ­interference effect. In his review of the research ­literature, Brady (1998) discussed several studies 
that provide support for each hypothesis. Since the publication of that review, Immink and Wright (2001) presented empirical evidence supporting roles for both explanations. Based on the results of two experiments, they concluded that random practice not only promotes a refinement of <u>motor programming processes</u> (i.e., the action plan reconstruction hypothesis), it also enhances the strength and quality of the memory representation of the movement variations learned during practice (i.e., the elaboration hypothesis). Results such as these indicate that rather than being competing explanations for the contextual interference effect, the elaboration and reconstruction hypotheses are complementary.

要确定这两个假设中哪一个最能说明情境干扰效应还需要大量的研究Brady（1998）在他文献综述中讨论了几项研究，同时为这两个假说提供了支持。自该综述发表后，Immink和 Wright（2001）提供了支持这两种解释的经验证据。基于两个实验的结果，他们得出结论：随机练习不仅促进了<u>运动编程过程</u><font color='red'>[!! 就是"形成动作程序的过程"的意思, 直译略怪异]</font>的完善（即动作计划重建假说），而且还增强了练习中所学到的运动变化的记忆表征的强度和质量（即精细加工假说）。诸如此类的结果表明，精细加工假说和重建假说二者并不是要争个高低对错，而是互为补充。

Examination of the brain activity associated with blocked and random practice has also provided support for both explanations of the CI effect. For example, Cross, Schmitt, and Grafton (2007) found that learners who practiced a finger-sequencing task in a random order used longer study times prior to movement execution than learners who practiced in a blocked order. In addition, fMRI data revealed group differences in the brain areas known to be involved in movement preparation, leading them to suggest that random practice engaged movement preparation processes to a greater extent than blocked practice. Cohen, Cross, Wymbs, and Grafton (2009) subsequently used <u>TMS</u> to the motor cortex (M1) ipsilateral to the limb used to perform the learning task to perturb movement preparation processes during random practice. Retention performance one day later revealed poorer performance for participants who had practiced randomly with <u>TMS</u> than those who had practiced randomly without TMS. Again, these findings highlight the important contribution that preparatory processes make to learning and they provide indirect support for the action plan reconstruction hypothesis, which maintains that the CI effect is a function of the more difficult action planning that accompanies random practice. 

对与分段练习与随机练习相关的大脑活动的研究也为背景干扰效应的两种解释提供了支持。例如，Cross、Schmitt 和 Grafton（2007）在一项按顺序移动手指的实验中发现发现，随机顺序的练习者比分段练习的练习者在运动执行前需要更长的学习时间。而fMRI数据也显示，在已知参与运动准备的大脑区域中存在群体差异，这使得他们认为随机练习比分段式练习能让练习者在更大程度上参与运动准备过程。Cohen, Cross, Wymbs, and Grafton (2009) 随后对执行任务的肢体同侧的运动皮层（M1）使用<u>TMS</u><font color='red'>[!! 建议加个译注, 这个词太专业了, 而且如果不知道是什么的话有碍于理解下文.(我一开始以为是某种类似 fMRI 的检测技术, 但带着这样的认识下文读不通, 查了才知道是一种干扰技术,用来影响脑内代谢和神经电活动的) ]</font>，以扰乱随机练习中的运动准备过程。一天后的保留测试显示，在随机练习的参与者中，使用TMS的比不使用TMS的成绩更差。这些发现再次强调了准备过程对学习的重要作用，也为行动计划重建假说提供了间接支持，因为该假说认为背景干扰效应与伴随随机练习而来的更困难的动作规划有关。

In contrast to the above-mentioned studies, Lin, Fisher, Winstein, Wu, and Gordon (2008) and Lin, Winstein, Fisher, and Wu (2010) found that TMS applied to the M1 area contralateral to the limb used to perform the task, immediately after <u>feedback  for the trial was presented</u>, eliminated the random-practice advantage in retention relative to blocked practice. These findings provide indirect support for the elaboration hypothesis because they reveal the importance of post-trial processing (where comparisons with other task variations would be made) to the CI effect. Taken all together, these neurophy­siological studies suggest that the CI effect involves specific processing activities that learners engage in before and after each practice attempt.

与上述研究相反，Lin，Fisher，Winstein，Wu，和 Gordon （2008） 和 Lin，Winstein，Fisher，和 Wu（2010）发现，<u>在被试者得到关于他们表现情况的反馈后</u><font color='red'>[!! 参考原始文献增添了一些说明]</font> ，立即对执行任务的肢体对侧的  M1  区域进行 TMS ，结果是在保留测试中随机练习相对于分段练习不再有优势。这些发现间接地为精细加工假说提供了支持，因为它们揭示了试验后处理（与任务其他变化形式的比较就发生在这个阶段）的重要性。综上所述，这些生理学研究表明，背景干扰效应与学习者在每次练习前后所进行的特定加工活动有关。

Regardless of which hypothesis, or combination of hypotheses, accounts for the contextual interference effect, three important learner-related characteristics are associated with the effect. One is that *higher levels of contextual interference involve greater attention demands during practice* than lower levels, which is predicted by both the elaboration and reconstruction hypotheses. Li and Wright (2000) provided evidence of the greater attention demands for random compared to blocked practice by requiring participants to perform a secondary choice reaction-time task between practice trials and just before initiating their movements for a practice trial. These results help explain earlier results that showed higher physiological activation associated with higher ­levels of contextual interference (e.g., Husak, Cohen, & Schandler, 1991). The second characteristic, which we discussed earlier, was identified by Simon and Bjork (2001): *People who practice ­according to a blocked schedule tend to overestimate how well they are learning during practice.* The third characteristic is that *higher levels of contextual interference encourage people to make more errors* and so they may encourage greater refinement in the process of detecting and correcting errors that is so central to learning (e.g., Broadbent et al., 2017).

无论用哪种或哪几种假说解释背景干扰效应，已经证明与学习者有关的三个重要特征与此效应的产生有关。其一是在练习过程中，较高的背景干扰比较低的情境干扰需要更高强度的注意力，精细加工假设和重建假说都可以预测这一点。Li 和 Wright （2000）通过要求参与者在两个练习单元间、第二个练习开始前完成一个选择反应时的次任务，提供了随机练习比分段练习更需要更高强度注意力的证据。这些结果有助于解释早期关于较高水平的生理激活与较高水平的背景干扰的相关性的研究（例如，Husak, Cohen, & Schandler, 1991）。第二个特征是 Simon 和 Bjork（2001）确定的（前面也讨论过）：使用分段练习的练习者往往会高估自己在练习中的学习效果。第三个特点是，较高的背景干扰会导致人们犯更多的错误，进而使人们在检测和纠正错误的过程中变得完善，而这一过程正是学习的核心（例如，Broadbent 等人，2017）。

**PRACTICE SPECIFICITY**

In chapter 13, you learned that the amount of transfer of learning is a function of the degree of similarity between practice and test characteristics, which means that the best learning will occur when practice characteristics are the same as those of the test. However, this conclusion appears to be at odds with the discussion so far in the present chapter in which practice variability is presented as an ­important practice characteristic that is critical for ­successful future test performance. How, then, can both of these seemingly contradictory principles be correct? As you will see in the following sections, we have discussed various aspects of practice specificity which can be seen as distinct, although related to the benefits of practice variability.

第13章中提到，学习的迁移量与练习特征和测验特征之间的相似程度有关，这意味着当练习的特征与测验的特征相同时，学习效果最好。然而，这个结论似乎与本章迄今为止的讨论不一致。在本章中，练习变异性被认为是练习的一个重要特征，对未来测试成绩的提高至关重要。那么，这两个看似矛盾的原则怎么可能都是正确的呢？As you will see in the following sections, we have discussed various aspects of practice specificity which can be seen as distinct, although related to the benefits of practice variability.

The **specificity of practice hypothesis** is one of the oldest principles of human learning. Its origins can be traced back to the early 1900s when Thorndike (1914; Thorndike & Woodworth, 1901) presented the *identical elements theory* to explain why positive transfer occurs between two skills or skill learning situations. Briefly, this theory, which was discussed in chapter 13, proposed that the more “elements” (i.e., physical and mental ­characteristics) two skills or situations have in common, the greater the amount of transfer of learning or performance. The practice specificity hypothesis can also be linked to our discussion in chapter 3 about motor abilities where we considered the specificity of motor abilities hypothesis, which was attributed to Franklin Henry in the 1960s (e.g., Henry, 1961a, 1961b). Henry’s hypothesis proposed that motor abilities are independent and task specific and that individuals have varying levels of many motor abilities. In addition, the relationship between perfor­mances by a person on two different skills would depend on the degree of common abilities between the skills. Finally, in chapter 12 in the discussion of various performer and performance characteristics that change during the course of learning a skill, you read about the influence of practice specificity in skill learning for a performer-related characteristic that does not change.

**练习特异性假说**（**specificity of practice hypothesis**）是关于学习的最古老的原则之一，其起源可以追溯到20世纪初。当时 Thorndike（Thorndike, 1914; Thorndike & Woodworth, 1901）提出了相同要素理论，以解释为什么两种技能或技能学习情境之间会发生正迁移。简而言之，这个理论（见第13章）认为，两种技能或情境的共同“要素”（即生理和心理特征）越多，学习或表现的迁移量就越大。练习特异性假说也可以与我们在第三章中关于运动能力的讨论联系起来。当时我们考虑了在20世纪60年代由 Franklin Henry 提出的专项运动能力假说(可参阅 Henry, 1961a, 1961b)。Henry 的假说认为，运动能力是独立和任务依赖的，并且每个个体在许多运动能力上都有着不同的水平。此外，一个人在两种不同技能上的表现水平之间的关系取决于这两种技能各自要求的运动能力之间有多少的重复。最后，我们在第12章指出，在学习过程中，练习者和他们的表现特征会发生各种变化。在那时我们就提到了一个在学习过程中不发生改变的特征就和练习变异性有关。

Researchers generally agree that sufficient research evidence exists to support the practice specificity hypothesis for at least three characteristics of motor skill learning and performance. We have discussed each of these in previous chapters, but we will consider them here as they apply to the organization of practice. After discussing each characteristic, we will address the question of how the practice specificity hypothesis relates to the practice variability hypothesis and the contextual interference effect.

研究人员普遍认为，有足够的研究证据表明练习特异性假说至少对运动技能学习和表现中的三个特征成立。我们已经在前几章中分别讨论了这三个特征，不过考虑到了解这些特征有利于组织练习，我们还是在这里再讨论一次。讨论完这三个特征后，我们就会来讨论练习特异性和练习变异性与背景干扰效应之间的关系。

**Practice Specificity for Sensory/Perceptual Characteristics**

**感觉/知觉特征中的练习特异性**

As you read in chapter 12, research by Proteau and his colleagues in Canada (e.g., Proteau, 1992) demonstrated that motor skill learning is *specific to the sources of sensory/perceptual information available during practice*. The specific focus of their research has been on the role of vision and proprioception as the sensory/perceptual information available during the performance of a skill. That focus was motivated by views that ­emphasized visual sensory feedback is important in the early stage of learning but is diminished in its importance with practice and eventually is replaced by proprioceptive feedback in its importance for performance (e.g., Fleishman’s view on the relationship of motor abilities to skill learning, which was discussed in chapter 3, and the Schmidt schema theory’s hypothesized changes over the course of skill learning, which was discussed in chapter 12). 

­正如第12章所述，Proteau 和他的同事在加拿大开展的研究（可参阅 Proteau, 1992）表明对于某一项运动技能的学习来说，练习过程中的感觉/知觉反馈具有特异性。[!! 翻得不太顺也略微调整了句子结构，希望没改变句意。我的理解是说感觉/知觉信息源在不同的技能学习中是特异的，比如练舞时有镜子不见得会促进在舞台上的表现，因为后者没有镜子，而镜子这种反馈源是“在舞蹈房练舞”这个学习过程中特异的。不过我确定我这么翻译能不能传达出想传达的意思，或许能再改改]他们具体的研究重点是视觉和本体感觉作为感觉/知觉反馈在技能表现时的作用。他们的研究重点受到了这样一些观点的启发，即认为<u>视觉感感觉反馈</u>只在学习的早期阶段很重要，随着练习的进行，其重要性会逐渐下降，并最终被本体感觉反馈所取代（可以参阅第3章讨论过的 Fleishman 对于运动能力与技能学习关系的看法以及第12章讨论过的 Schmidt模式理论对技能学习过程中的变化的预测）。

In contrast to views promoting the idea that visual feedback becomes less important as learning continues Proteau’s research consistently showed the opposite effect: If a person has vision available during practice, vision remains an essential source of sensory information throughout the stages of learning. In fact, performance ­typically decreases when vision is not available during a retention or transfer test. Several examples of this ­research were presented in chapter 12 in which ­researchers showed support for Proteau’s hypothesis for the learning of a variety of motor skills, such as manual aiming, power lifting, and walking. In addition to those studies, a more recent one by Moradi, Movahedi, and Salehi (2014) found similar vision effects for learning a basketball free-throw shooting skill. 

然而 Proteau 的研究却一直呈现出与上述观点相反的结果。他的研究表明，如果练习者开始练习的时候有视觉反馈，那么在整个学习阶段，视觉始终会是感官反馈的重要来源。更准确地说，如果保留测试或迁移测试中没有视觉反馈，练习者的成绩通常都会下降。第12章中还提到研究人员做了更多这方面的研究。他们研究了各种运动技能的学习，如<u>手动瞄准</u>、举重和在平衡杆上行走等，在其中得出了同样的结果。[!! 做了大改，因为直译太奇怪了，想不出来好的顺序，就只能意译了] 除了这些研究，Moradi, Movahedi 和 Salehi（2014）最近所做的一项研究发现在篮球罚球技能的学习中也有类似的现象。

An especially notable finding in some of those studies is that as the amount of practice with vision increases, the need for vision on a subsequent retention or transfer test also increases (Proteau, Tremblay, & DeJaeger, 1998). Evidence has indicated that this increased need for vision during retention and transfer is not because the availability of vision during practice prevented the processing of proprioceptive information, but because practice with vision encourages people to prefer to use the same motor plan to perform the skill without vision (on transfer tests) as they used during practice with vision (Mackrous & Proteau, 2007).

这些研究中有一个特别值得一提的发现，即随着练习者反复进行有视觉反馈的练习，他们在随后的保留测试与迁移测试中对视觉的需求也会随之增加（Proteau, Tremblay, & DeJaeger, 1998）。有证据表明，在保留测试与迁移测试过程中对视觉需求的增加并不是因为在练习过程中有视觉反馈从而阻碍了本体感觉信息的处理，而是因为有视觉反馈的练习促使人们在没有视觉反馈的迁移测试中也使用与练习中同样的<u>运动方式</u>（Mackrous & Proteau, 2007）。

A different approach to the practice specificity effect of vision during learning involved the use of observational learning (Osman, Bird, & Heyes, 2005). The experiment involved participants learning an eight-item sequence in a serial reaction time task on a computer keyboard. After observing a skilled model demonstrate the sequence with the right hand, participants then practiced the task with their right hand and then their left hand. Results showed that the observation of the model influenced performance only with the right hand.

研究视觉的练习特异性的另一种方法是让练习者进行观察学习（observational learning）。在 Osman 等人的实验（Osman, Bird, & Heyes, 2005）中，被试者要学习用键盘完成一个具有八个项目的<u>serial reaction time task</u>. [!! 引自 Wikipedia 的解释: **Serial reaction time** (SRT) is a commonly used parameter for measuring implicit learning. In a SRT task, participants are asked to repeatedly respond to a fixed set of stimuli in which each cue signals that a particular response (i.e., button press) needs to be made. Unbeknownst to the participant, there are probabilities governing the transition between the cues, and thus required responses following one cue have some predictability. As a result, reaction time (RTs) to these cues becomes increasingly fast as subjects learn and utilize these transition probabilities. ]被试者在观察完一位熟练于此项技能的人用右手执行的的规范动作后就开始分别练习用左手和右手完成该技能。结果表明，观察用右手执行的的规范动作只影响了他们用右手执行这项技能的水平。

Neurophysiological evidence also demonstrates the practice specificity effect for sensory characteristics. For example, in a study in which researchers used fMRI to observe the brain activity associated with learning a timing skill (Jantzen, Steinberg, & Kelso, 2005), participants practiced tapping their thumb with the index finger to a specific rhythm that was paced by either a visual or auditory metronome. Eventually the metronome stopped but the participants continued to tap the rhythm. The brain areas active during practice with the visual metronome remained active during the tapping without the visual metronome. These brain areas were those in the visual dorsal stream, which we discussed in chapter 6 as the vision-for-action visual system.

神经生理学方面的证据也证明了感觉特征的练习特异性效应。例如，在一项研究中，研究人员使用 fMRI 观察被试者学习一项时机选择技能时的大脑活动（Jantzen, Steinberg, & Kelso, 2005）。这项研究中的被试者要练习按照一个视觉节拍器或听觉节拍器的节奏用食指敲击拇指。在节拍器停下后，被试者还要继续按照相同的节奏进行敲击。结果表明，在使用视觉节拍器练习时活跃的大脑区域在没有视觉节拍器的敲击过程中仍然活跃。

参与者练习用食指敲击他们的拇指，以达到视觉或听觉节拍器的特定节奏。最终节拍器停止了，但参与者继续敲击节奏。在使用视觉节拍器练习时活跃的大脑区域在没有视觉节拍器的敲击过程中仍然活跃。这些脑区位于视觉背侧通路，也就是在第6章讨论的视觉行动系统。

**Practice Specificity for Performance Context Characteristics**

**表现情境特征中的练习特异性**

You read in chapter 10 that the encoding specificity principle is a well-established characteristic of ­memory. This principle identifies the strong association between encoding and retrieval contexts for memory performance by stating that the more a memory test (i.e., retrieval) context resembles the practice (i.e., encoding) context, the better will be the retention performance. Recall that an important part of the perfor­mance context issue is the distinction between intentional and incidental remembering. *Intentional* remembering refers to when you must remember specified characteristics of an environmental context, whereas *incidental* remembering refers to the remembering of related but nonessential parts of the context. For example, you are practicing the ­return of a serve in tennis, and you are told to estimate and report the ball speed for a serve. If you are then asked to report not only the ball speed but also the location in the service court where the ball landed, you will likely be able to report both, even though you were not instructed to give attention to or remember the ball’s landing location. In this example, reporting the ball speed represents intentional remembering; reporting the ball’s landing location represents incidental remembering.

第10章中提到，编码特异性原则是记忆的一个公认的特征。这一原则指出，编码环境和检索环境与记忆表现之间存在着紧密的联系，即记忆测试（即检索）环境与练习（即编码）环境越相似，保留效果就会越好。回顾一下，表现环境问题的一个重要部分是有意记忆和偶然记忆之间的区别。有意记忆是指你必须记住环境背景的特定特征，而偶然记忆是指记住环境中相关但不重要的部分。例如，你正在练习网球中的回球，你被告知要估计并报告发球的球速。如果结束后不仅你要求报告球速，还要你报告球在发球区的落点，那么你很可能会都能说的出来，尽管你没有被要求注意或记住球的落点。在这个例子中，报告的球速代表有意记忆；报告球的落点代表偶然记忆。

Research by David Wright and his colleagues extended the performance context aspect of the encoding specificity principle to motor skill learning situations. Their research consistently demonstrated that characteristics of a practice environmental context that are not parts of the actual skill to be learned also get learned (e.g., Wright & Shea, 1991, 1994). In these experiments participants typically learned three- or four-digit sequences of key presses on a computer keyboard. Participants saw specific ­sequences of the numeral keys displayed on the computer monitor as the intentional items they needed to learn. In addition, each sequence was color coded, which created an association between a number sequence and its color. Participants were not told about the color-­coding feature, which means that color was an incidental part of the performance context; it was not a part of the skill that the participants were told to learn. However, their performance was better on the transfer test when they were shown both the number sequence (the intentional items to be learned) together with the associated color coding (the incidental part of the practice environment) than when they were shown the same number sequences with different colors. Thus they learned not only the number sequences that they were told to learn, but also the colors associated with the sequences. Interestingly, in interviews after the experiment, participants indicated that they were unaware of the number-color relationship.

David Wright 和他的同事的研究将编码特异性原则中的出现的表现背景问题推广到了运动技能学习的情境上。他们的研究一致表明，练习环境背景中的那些不属于要学习的技能的特征也会被学习（例如，Wright & Shea, 1991, 1994）。在他们的实验中，被试者通常学习在键盘上执行三位或四位数的按键序列。被试者看到显示器上显示的特定的数字键序列是他们要学习的有意项目。此外，每个序列都上了颜色，这就在数字序列和其颜色之间建立了关联。被试者没有被告知有关颜色的事情，这意味着颜色是表现背景的一个附带部分，不是参与者被告知要学习的技能的一部分。然而，在迁移测试中，被试者在同时看到数字序列（需要学习的有意项目）和对应的颜色（练习环境的附带部分）时的表现比看到上了不同颜色的相同数字序列时更好。因此，他们不仅学会了被告知要学习的数字序列，而且还学会了与这些序列对应的颜色。有趣的是，在实验后的访谈中，被试者表示他们没有意识到数字与颜色的关系。

What is evident from the research investigat­ing performance contexts is that people *learn more about the context than they are explicitly instructed to learn*. Parts of the environmental context in which a skill is practiced get included in what ­people learn. When these incidental parts of the context are available during a test, they serve as cues, or aids, to help retrieve the memory representation of the learned skill. Conversely, when these incidental environmental context features are not available during the test environment, performance is diminished. Examples of this effect include the use of mirrors in dance studios and weight training rooms. Because the mirrors are part of the practice environment, the visual feedback received from them becomes part of what is learned. When the mirrors are not available, as would occur in a dance performance on a stage or in a weight lifting competition, performance of these activities would be poorer than it would be with the mirrors present. 

从这些研究表现背景研究中可以得到一个显而易见的发现，那就是人们对表现背景的了解比他们被明确指示要学习的要多。技能表现情境的一部分被纳入了人们的学习内容。如果测试环境中也具有这些情境的附带部分，那这些附带部分就会提示或辅助工具来帮助人们检索所学技能的记忆表征。相反，如果测试环境中没有这些情境的附带部分，表现水平就会下降。舞蹈室和重量训练室中镜子的使用就是这一效应的例子，因为镜子是练习环境的一部分，从镜子中得到的视觉反馈成为了所学内容的一部分。当要在舞台上的表演舞蹈或参加举重比赛中时，镜子不再存在，因此在这些情境下的表现会比有镜子时要差。

According to Shea and Wright (1995), the decision of which specific skill to perform in a situation and the speed of its selection depend on the strength of the relationship between intentional and incidental features in the perfor­mance environment. The implication for skill training is to include as many features of a test environmental context as possible in the practice environmental context. For example, if a goal of gait training in physical therapy is for the patient to be able to walk in a crowded mall as part of his or her daily living activities, then therapy sessions should include supervised walking in a crowded mall when the therapist determines that the patient can engage in this type of activity. In terms of its application to sports situations, the learning of the incidental parts of players’ environmental context during practice and competitions leads to the “home field advantage” that is commonly observed in sports competitions. This means that parts of the performance context in the “home field” are more familiar to the home team because they learned those parts when they practiced in that context. Thus, they have learned important context cues that aid their performance, even though they never practiced intentionally learning those cues.

­根据 Shea 和 Wright（1995）的研究，决定在某种情况下具体执行哪种技能以及以何种速度执行技能取决于表现环境中有意特征和偶然特征之间的关系的强度。这给技能训练带来的启示是要在练习情境中尽可能多地包括测试情境的特征。例如在身体康复的情境下，如果步态康复训练的目标是让病人能够在日常生活中自如地拥挤的商场中行走，那么一旦治疗师确定病人可以执行这种类型的活动，就应该安排病人在监督下在拥挤的商场中行走。而在体育运动的情境下，球员在练习和比赛期间对环境背景的偶然记忆导致了体育比赛中普遍出现的 "主场优势"。这意味着 "主场 "的表现环境的部分特征对主队来说更熟悉，因为他们在该环境下练习时已经学习了这些特征。因此，他们已经具备了有助于他们表现的重要的环境线索，尽管他们从未有意学习这些线索。

**Practice Specificity for Cognitive Processing Characteristics**

**认知过程特征中的练习特异性**

In chapter 13, one of the explanations of positive transfer considered the similarity of the cognitive processes required by the skills or learning situations. According to the *transfer-appropriate processing theory*, the type of practice that is best when a person is learning a skill requires the same type of cognitive processing activity that will be required in a transfer test, regardless of the physical similarity between the practice and test skills and situations. For example, if the test situation will require rapid decision making, practice should consist of activities that require rapid ­decision making. A good example of this type of rapid decision-making situation is when a soccer player dribbles the ball down the field and sees that a defender will soon confront him or her, the player must decide very quickly whether to continue dribbling, or to pass the ball to a teammate. One of the reasons for this relationship is that the cognitive processing that is a part of practice becomes a part of what is learned. As a ­result, the cognitive processing demands of a practice situation are a practice-specific aspect of skill learning.

在第13章中，对正迁移的一种解释是技能或学习情境所要求的认知过程的相似性。根据*迁移适当加工理论*，当一个人学习某项技能时，最有帮助的练习需要包括与迁移测试中所需的相同类型的认知加工活动，而练习技能和测试技能及二者的表现情境之间的物理相似性则没那么重要。例如，如果测试情境需要快速决策，练习中也应该包括需要快速决策的活动。对于这种快速决策情境，有一个很好的例子是，当一名足球运动员运球到球场下，看到一名防守队员即将与他对抗，球员必须快速决定是继续运球，还是将球传给队友。之所以会出现这种情况，一个原因是认知过程作为练习的一部分，最终也成为了练习者所学到的一部分。因此，练习情境的认知加工需求也是技能学习中的练习特异性的一个方面。

An experiment by Pellecchia (2005) provides a good example of the practice specificity of cognitive demands during skill learning. Participants practiced standing still for 30 sec on a balance platform on which the surface was covered with a foam pad to reduce somatosensory feedback and increase reliance on vestibular and visual feedback. Two groups of participants practiced only the balance skill (single-task training) or that skill together with a cognitive secondary task (dual-task training), which was counting backward by threes from a three-digit number that was randomly presented on each trial. Results showed that when both groups performed a transfer test one week later with the dual-task condition, the single-task training group showed an increase in postural sway, while the dual-task training group did not, which demonstrated that the cognitive processing demands imposed by the dual-task training became a part of what was learned. The similarity ­between the cognitive processing demands during practice and the test resulted in successful performance on the dual-task transfer test one week later.

Pellecchia （2005）的一项实验为技能学习过程中认知需求的练习特异性提供了一个很好的例子。该实验的被试者要在一个平衡平台上练习站立30秒，平台表面覆盖有泡沫垫，以减少体感反馈，同时增加对前庭和视觉反馈的依赖。两组被试者分别只练习平衡技能（单任务训练）或同时执行该技能与一个认知辅助任务（双任务训练），该辅助任务要求被试者从每次试验中随机显示的一个三位数开始倒数三个数。结果表明，当一周后两组同时在双任务条件下进行迁移测试时，单任务训练组的身体摆动增加，而双任务训练组却没有，这表明双任务训练额外增加的认知加工需求也成为所学内容的一部分。正是练习过程中的认知加工需求和测试之间的认知加工需求相似性导致了双任务组一周后在双任务迁移测试中的成功表现。 

A more recent study by Song and BŽdard (2015) showed particularly strong context specificity effects during dual-task practice. When participants concurrently practiced an aiming task and a secondary discrimination task, they retained the accuracy of the aiming movement when it was tested later with the secondary task; but their performance regressed to baseline levels when they were tested without the secondary task, despite the additional attentional capacity that would have been  available without the secondary task.

Song 和 BŽdard（2015）最近的一项研究表明，在双任务练习中，练习特异性效应特别强。在他们的研究中，被试者要同时练习瞄准任务和一个附加的辨识任务。在同时测试瞄准和辨识的测试中，被试者保持了相当的瞄准准度；但当在没有附加任务的情况下测试时，被试者的表现回归到基准水平，哪怕他们的注意力水平会因为没有附加任务而得到提高。

**Relating the Practice Variability and Specificity Hypotheses**

**练习变异性和练习特异性之间的关系**

Although the practice specificity hypothesis may appear to be at odds with the practice variability hypothesis, research indicates that each hypothesis may pertain to specific aspects of the practice context. The *practice variability* *hypothesis* explains the retention and transfer benefit associated with practicing multiple variations of a skill. On the other hand, the *practice specificity hypothesis* explains why retention and transfer performance tend to be better when the practice and test ­contexts are similar relative to (a) the sensory/perceptual information available, (b) the environmental context in which the skill is performed, and (c) the cognitive processing requirements. 

尽管练习特异性假说似乎与练习变异性假说不一致，但研究表明，每个假说都可能与练习背景的特定方面相关。练习变异性假说解释了练习某项技能的多种变化形式对保留测试和迁移测试带来的好处。另一方面，练习特异性假说解释了为什么当练习和测试情境在这三个方面：（a）可用的感觉/知觉反馈、（b）执行技能的情境和（c）认知加工要求相似时，保留测试和迁移测试的表现往往更好。 

Also, it is worth noting that for many contextual interference studies, the higher contextual interference during practice was more similar to the test situation than was the lower contextual interference practice condition. This is not to say that the contextual interference effect is a practice specificity effect, but that there are situations in which the relationship between the practice and test conditions are similar.

此外值得注意的是，在许多对背景干扰效应的研究中，产生较高水平的背景干扰的练习情境比产生较低水平的背景干扰的练习情境更类似于测试情境。这并不是说背景干扰效应也是一种练习特异性效应，只是说在某些情况下练习情境和测试情境之间的关系是相似的。[!! 英文这里说的相似就是这一段一开始说的那种情境, 翻出的中文可能让读者不知道是什么什么东西相似, 标准出来留待进一步润色] 

***Especial skills.***A new phenomenon, referred to as *especial skills*, has added another dimension to our understanding of practice specificity and variability. The especial skill effect was first demonstrated by Keetch, Schmidt, Lee, and Young (2005) in an experiment in which skilled basketball players performed shots at various distances from the basket. <u>The results showed that they consistently shot more accurately from the foul line than would be predicted from their shooting accuracy at distances shorter than 9, 11, and 13 ft and longer than 17, 19, and 21 ft the foul line distance.</u> The effect occurred even when the lines of the court were covered to control for the possible effects of the incidental learning the players had experienced throughout their careers. The effect has been replicated with skilled baseball pitchers, who pitched more accurately from the regulation pitching distance (60.5 ft) than would have been predicted from their accuracy at distances shorter than and longer than the regulation distance (Simons, Wilson, Wilson, & Theall, 2009). It has also been replicated with skilled archers, who shot more accurately from the regulation distance (18 m) than would have been predicted from their accuracy at shorter and longer distances (Nabavinik, Abaszadeh, Mehranmanesh, & Rosenbaum, 2018).

***特殊技能*** 一种被称为<u>特殊技能</u>[!! 术语 有待翻译]的新现象为我们提供了另一种理解练习特异性和练习变异性的视角。特殊技能效应于 Keetch、Schmidt、Lee 和 Young（2005）的一项实验中首次被发现。在实验中，他们要求熟练的篮球运动员在离篮筐不同距离处投篮。研究人员根据这些运动员在距篮筐9、11、13、17、19和21英尺处结的投篮情况对他们在距篮筐15英尺处的罚球线上的投篮准确度进行了预测。但结果却表明，他们在罚球线上的投篮准确度一直高于研究人员的预测。[!! 个人认为本章最难读的句子, 没有之一, 反复读了n遍才搞明白, 建议重新校对一下这句的翻译防止我理解失误] 研究人员随后把球场上的标线全部覆盖以排除可能由之前练习中的偶然记忆造成的影响，但结果依旧。另一组研究人员在熟练的棒球投手间进行类似的实验，也产生了同样的效应。棒球投手们在标准投球距离(60.5英尺)下的表现也比预测的更精准(Simons，Wilson，Wilson & Theall，2009)。在熟练的弓箭手中也有类似结果，他们在标准距离(18 m)下的射击精度也高于预测值(Nabavinik，Abaszadeh，Mehranmanesh & Rosen Baum，2018)。 

These findings are intriguing because they support tenets of the practice variability and practice specificity hypotheses, yet they cannot be accounted for completely by either hypothesis. The ability to perform accurately from various distances, even though accuracy decreased systematically as distance from the target increased, supports the postulate in Schmidt’s (1975) schema theory of a generalizable memory representation for a class of movements. However, schema theory cannot account for why performance at one specific distance*—*a distance that would be practiced much more extensively than any other distances*—*would be so much better than predicted from performance at the other distances. The *especial* performance at the regulation distance is more consistent with the specificity of practice hypothesis. Despite the uncertainty that surrounds the locus of the especial skill effect, research on this intriguing phenomenon has the potential to greatly enhance our understanding of the role of specificity and variability in motor skill learning (Breslin, Schmidt, & Lee, 2012).

这些发现十分发人深思，因为它们同时支持练习变异性假说和练习特异性假说所提出的准则，但无论是哪种假说都不能独立地解释这些现象。尽管准确率随着与目标的距离增加逐步下降，但在不同的距离上准确执行的能力还是支持了 Schmidt（1975）的模式理论中关于 a generalizable memory representation for a class of movements 的假设。[!! 术语太多] 然而，模式理论无法解释为什么在某个特定距离（练习者在这个距离上进行了比其他距离多得多的练习）上的表现会比基于其他距离上的表现所预测的要好得多。这种在标准距离上的*特殊*表现更符合练习特异性。尽管我们尚不确定什么地方会出现特殊技能效应，但对这一有趣现象的研究将可能极大地增进我们对特异性和变异性在运动技能学习中作用的理解（Breslin, Schmidt, & Lee, 2012）。

**SUMMARY**

Variations of movement and context experiences are important ingredients for practice conditions that increase a person’s capability to perform the practiced skill successfully and to adapt to conditions he or she has not experienced previously.

动作变化和环境变化是练习情境的重要组成部分，它们可以提高练习者执行技能和适应新环境的能力。

Research evidence shows that *variable practice* leads to superior retention and transfer test performance when compared to *constant practice.*

研究表明，使用变异练习的练习者在保留测试和迁移测试中的表现比使用固定练习的练习者更好。

To determine the characteristics of a test context that should be varied in practice, identify the regulatory and nonregulatory conditions of the test context. Which of these conditions should be varied in practice depends on whether the skill is a closed or open skill.

为了确定练习情境中需要变化的特征，首先需要确定出测试情境中的调控条件和非调控条件。然后再根据技能是开放的还是闭锁的来确定是否要在练习中变化这些条件。

An important practice condition concern is how to organize the variety of experiences for a practice session, unit of instruction, or therapy protocol. The *contextual interference effect* provides a basis for scheduling these experiences during practice.

关于练习条件，尤其需要关注的一点是如何把变化组织到练习课、教学单元和治疗方案中。而*背景干扰效应*为这一问题提供了参考依据。

The contextual interference effect occurs when practice schedules that include higher amounts of contextual interference (e.g., random practice schedules) lead to better learning than those that include low amounts (e.g., blocked practice schedules).

当背景干扰多的练习计划（如随机练习）产生的学习效果比背景干扰少的练习计划（如分段练习）要更好时，就可以说出现了背景干扰效应。

Research evidence indicates that the contextual interference effect applies to beginners as well as to skilled performers and to laboratory skills and a wide range of sports and everyday skills; however, the effect is not applicable to the learning of all motor skills or to all learning situations. Researchers have not identified the specific factors that limit the generalization of the contextual interference effect.

研究表明，从初学者到老手，从实验室任务到许多运动技能以及日常技能，背景干扰效应都能发挥作用。但这并不是说背景干扰效应可以应用于所有类型的技能以及所有的学习情境。现有的研究还无法确定究竟是什么因素限制了背景干扰效应的适用范围。

Two hypotheses predominate as explanations for why the contextual interference effect occurs: the *elaboration hypothesis* and the *action plan reconstruction hypothesis.*

在解释背景干扰效应的众多假说中，*精细加工假说*和*动作计划重建假设*是最广为接受的。

The practice specificity hypothesis differs from the practice variability hypothesis and contextual interference effect by proposing that the best transfer test performance will result from practice situations in which characteristics are the most similar to those of the transfer test. Research has shown that the following three characteristics of motor skill learning and performance support this hypothesis:

练习特异性假说与练习变异性假说、背景干扰效应不同，该假说认为练习情境设置的与迁移测试的情境越相似，在迁移测试中的表现也会最好。[!! 有结构性改动]研究表明，以下三个关于运动技能学习和表现的特征支持这一假说：

The sources of sensory/perceptual information available during practice

练习中可获得的感觉/知觉反馈的来源

Performance context characteristics

表现情境特征

Cognitive processing characteristics

认知过程特征

Although the practice specificity hypothesis appears to contradict the predictions of the practice variability hypothesis, research indicates that each hypothesis relates to different practice and test characteristics. The practice specificity hypothesis relates primarily to certain characteristics of the practice and test context, whereas the practice variability hypothesis relates specifically to the movement characteristics of the skill that is learned.

尽管练习特异性假说似乎与练习变异假说相矛盾，但研究表明，每种假说各自适用于不同的练习和测试特征。练习特异性假说主要与练习和测试情境的某些特征有关，而练习变异性假说则具体与所学技能的运动特征有关。

**POINTS FOR THE PRACTITIONER**

The goal of practice sessions should be to provide opportunities for people to develop the capability to perform activities that will require the use of the skills being practiced and to achieve the action goals of those activities wherever they occur.

练习课的最终目的是要培养学习者在任何需要的场合中成功执行技能的能力。[!! 做了大幅删改, 如果全部直译太拖沓, 反而模糊了重点. 这一句的重点就两个: 1. 能表现技能 2.能在任何场合达到动作目标. 那干脆合为一句"在任何需要的场合中成功执行技能"]

Practice conditions that encourage people to make errors are beneficial for helping people to learn skills in a way that maximizes their capability to perform the skills in a variety of contexts and situations.

促使练习者犯错的练习情境会最大限度地提高练习者在各种情境下执行技能的能力。

When teaching a motor skill that will require the person to adapt to environmental context conditions or situations that the person hasn’t experienced before, design practice conditions that will require the person to perform the skills in as many different environmental context conditions and situations as possible can be created.

如果正在教授的技能需要练习者不断适应各种新的环境和表现情境，可以设计这样的练习情境，让练习者尽可能多地在不同的环境条件和情境下表现技能。

When teaching a motor skill that will require performance in environmental contexts in which the regulatory conditions will not change, such as shooting free throws in basketball or ascending or descending a set of stairs at home, design practice conditions that will require the person to perform the skills in the specific environmental context in which he or she will be required to perform the skill, but provide experiences with as many nonregulatory conditions and situations as possible.

在教授需要在调控条件不变的环境中执行的技能，如教授篮球罚球和在家里上下楼梯时，练习情境应该设计的与练习者要执行技能时的特定环境一样，但同时还要尽可能多的改变非调控条件。

When organizing practice sessions for learning ­multiple skills or variations of a skill, provide opportunities to practice all the skills or variations in each session. When possible, arrange to have the skills in each session practiced in a random arrangement.

为多种技能或一种技能的多种变化形式组织练习课时，要在每一节练习课中安排练习所有的技能或变化形式。如果条件允许，最好能随机安排每节课的技能练习。

If the test conditions for a skill that a person is learning will not allow visual feedback, develop practice conditions that do not provide visual feedback, such as the use of mirrors, especially for practice sessions that immediately precede the test situation.

如果要学习的技能的测试情境中没有视觉反馈，那么就练习情境也设置为不提供视觉反馈（比如不使用镜子），特别是在测试前的几节的练习课。

Include in a practice situation as many of the environmental context features of an upcoming test environment as possible.

在练习中尽可能多地包括将来的测试情境中的环境特征。

**A Professional Golfer’s Use of Random Practice**

**一个职业高尔夫球手对于随机练习法的应用**

Amy Alcott, a professional golfer on the LPGA tour and member of the World Golf Hall of Fame, described in *Golf Magazine* (December, 1991) a drill she used to help her make a swing of the correct length and strength for the distance. She practiced pitch shots that are 20, 40, 60, and 80 yards from flags marking each distance. Before she hit a ball, her teacher, Walter Keller, called out the yardage for the shot. She looked at the flag, set up, and swung. Then, her teacher called out another yardage for the next shot. She says that “One after another, he’d call out yardages—60, 20, 40, 80, 40, 60.” Alcott states that she finds this type of practice “invaluable,” and repeated it from time to time throughout the season.

Amy Alcott 是LPGA巡回赛的职业高尔夫球手，也是世界高尔夫名人堂的成员。她曾在《高尔夫杂志》（1991第12期）中叙述了一种练习方法，她用这种方法来帮助自己在比赛中打出正确的挥杆长度和力量。她在距离洞口20、40、60和80码的旗子处练习击球。在她击球前，她的老师 Walter Keller 都会提前喊出击球的码数。她在找到对应旗子后，摆放完毕后挥杆击球。之后，她的老师会喊出下一次击球对应的码数。她说“她的老师会一个接一个喊出击球的码数 60，20，40，80，40，60。” 她还发现这种练习方法非常有用，并且在整个赛季中不时地反复使用这个方法。

**深入阅读**

An important study by Simon and Bjork (2001) investigated how well people who are practicing multiple variations of a motor skill can assess their own learning during practice, which is commonly referred to as *metacog­nition.* The significance of their study is twofold. First, it was the first investigation of metacognition as it relates to the learning of motor skills (it has a longer history in the study of verbal-conceptual learning; see Nelson, 1992). Second, it demonstrated that practicing multiple variations of a motor skill with a low amount of contextual interference influences learners to be overconfident about how well they will perform on an upcoming test.

Simon 和 Bjork （2001）的一项研究调查了练习多种运动技能的人在练习过程中评估自己学习的能力，这一能力通常被称为元认知。这一研究有两个重要意义。首先，这是第一次对运动技能的学习中的元认知进行的研究（对 verbal-conceptual learning [!!]领域中的元认知的研究则由来已久，详见 Nelson，1992）它在言语-概念学习的研究中有更长的历史；见纳尔逊，1992年)。其次，该研究证明了在低背景干扰下练习多种运动技能会影响学习者高估自己在即将到来的测试中的表现。

**Judgments about How Much People Are Learning during Practice**

**评估人们在练习中的习得量**

**The Simon and Bjork (2001) Experiment**

**Simon 和 Bjork 的实验（2001）**

***Participants:***Forty-eight undergraduate university students.

**被试者：** 48位大学本科生

***Motor skills practiced:***The task required participants to learn to press three specified five-key sequences on the number pad of a computer keyboard. The sequences differed in the patterns of numbers to press and overall goal movement times (MT). (*Sequence 1* was the 9-5-1-2-3 keys with a 900 msec MT goal; *Sequence 2* was the 3-6-5-8-4 keys with a 1,200 msec MT goal; *Sequence 3* was the 4-2-5-8-9 keys with a 1,500 msec MT goal.)

**练习的任务：**被试者要练习在数字键盘上以一定的顺序按下五个键。共有三种不同的按键序列，每种按键序列的目标用时（MT）也不同。（序列1是9-5-1-2-3，目标MT为900毫秒；序列2是3-6-5-8-4，目标MT为1200毫秒；序列3是4-2-5-8-9，目标MT为1500毫秒）

**Practice conditions:**Participants practiced each sequence in a blocked or random order until they performed thirty successful trials for each sequence; that is, they pressed the correct keys (unsuccessful trials were repeated later in the practice session). Knowledge of results (KR) was provided after each trial in terms of (a) whether or not the correct keys had been pressed, (b) the actual MT for the trial, and (c) the number of milliseconds faster or slower the actual MT was than the goal MT.

**练习情境**：被试者使用组块练习法或随机练习法练习每种按键序列，直到他们对每个按键序列都完成了三十次成功的尝试；也就是说，他们按下了正确的键（不成功的尝试将在随后的在练习中重复进行）。在每次尝试后，根据（a）是否按下了正确的键，（b）本次尝试的实际用时（MT），以及（c）实际用时比目标用时快或慢的毫秒数提供结果反馈（KR）。

*Blocked practice schedule—*All trials of each sequence were practiced as a unique set of trials until the thirty-trial criterion was achieved for the sequence (e.g., 900—900—900 . . . 1,200—1,200—1,200 . . . 1,500—1,500—1,500 . . . ).

*分段练习计划*——每种按键序列都配有一组单独的练习，直到练习者对当前按键序列完成了三十次成功的尝试后才进行下一种按键序列的练习。

[!! 英文很简练, 直译会不清不楚, 所以做了比较大的调整]

*Random practice schedule—*Each of the three sequences was practiced in a random order until the thirty-trial criterion was achieved for each sequence.

*随机练习计划*——同时以随机顺序进行三种按键序列的练习，直到练习者对每个按键序列都完成了三十次成功的尝试。

***Assessment of participants’ judgment of learning (JOL):***At the end of every fifth successful trial, participants were asked to predict as closely as possible their estimate of how close they would come to the goal MT for that sequence on a test scheduled for the next day (they were told to predict as if they would ­re­ceive no additional practice trials).

***评估被试者对学习情况的判断（JOL）：***每五次成功的尝试结束时，实验人员会要求被试者尽可能准确地预测他们在第二天的测试中对该按键序列的目标MT（被试者还被告知要在假设他们没有进行该按键序列的更多练习的情况下进行预测[!! 有点拗口, 或许能再改改. ]）。

***Retention test:*** One day after completing the practice trials, participants performed a paper-and-pencil test of their recall of the key-press sequences and goal MTs they practiced the previous day and predicted their expected MT performance in terms of how close they would come to each goal MT. They then performed three trials of each sequence in a blocked ­order and random order. No KR was provided on any of these trials.

***保留测试：***在完成练习试验的第二天，参与者会进行一场笔试来测试他们对于前一天练习的按键序列和目标MT的回忆，并根据他们与每个目标MT的接近程度来预测他们的预期MT表现。之后他们对每一个序列按照组块和随机的顺序分别进行了三次试验。试验中没有提供KR。

结果：

The top panel of figure 16.5 below shows that the blocked group was significantly more accurate during early practice but significantly less accurate during retention. The bottom panel shows that the blocked group predicted much better performance than the random group during acquisition and retention.

图16.5的上图显示分段练习组在早期练习中明显有着更高的准确度，但在保留测试期间准确度明显降低。图16.5的下的图显示在习得技能和保留测试期间，分段练习组对自己的预测比随机练习组对自己的预测更好。

A study by Hanlon (1996) demonstrated the benefit of a random practice schedule for the physical therapy of unilateral stroke patients who needed to rehabilitate the use of their hemiparetic (i.e., partially paralyzed) arm to perform functional movement sequences.

Hanlon （1996）的一项研究表面，随机练习计划有益于单侧中风患者的物理治疗。这些患者需要恢复使用他们的轻度偏瘫（即部分瘫痪）的手臂来完成一些功能性运动序列的能力。

**An Application of the Contextual Interference Effect to the Physical Therapy of Stroke Patients**

**背景干扰效应在中风患者的物理治疗中的应用**

***Participants:*** Twenty-four adult patients with chronic hemiparesis due to a unilateral cerebrovascular accident (CVA), which is commonly called a stroke.

***被试者：***24名因单侧脑血管淤血（CVA）而慢性轻度偏瘫的成年患者，通常称为中风患者。

***Movement sequence practiced:*** Participants used their hemiparetic arm to perform a five-step sequence designed to approximate steps needed to (1) open a cupboard door, (2) grasp a coffee cup by the handle, (3) lift the cup off its shelf, (4) place the cup on the counter, and (5) release the grasp.

***运动序列练习：***被试者用轻度偏瘫的手来完成五个连续的动作：（1）打开橱柜的门，（2）抓住咖啡杯的把手，（3）把咖啡杯从架子上抬起来，（4）把咖啡杯放在柜台上，（5）松开手。

***Practice conditions:***

***练习情境：***

*Random practice schedule—*Ten trials in one ­session per day until participants achieved the performance criterion of three consecutive correct trials. Between each trial of the movement sequence, participants performed three other tasks with the hemiparetic arm: (1) pointing, (2) touching specified objects, 
(3) touching specified spots on a horizontal surface.

*随机练习组*——每天一次，每次包含十次练习，达到被试者能够连续三次正确操作的标准为止。在运动序列的练习之间，被试者要用偏瘫的手臂完成其他三项任务：（1）指方向，（2）触摸指定的物体（3）触摸水平表面上指定的一点。

*Blocked practice schedule—*Ten trials in one ­ses­sion per day until participants achieved the ­perfor­mance criterion of three consecutive correct trials.

*分段练习组*——每天一次，每次包含十次练习，达到被试者能够连续三次正确操作的标准为止。

*No practice control condition—*No practice trials.

*无练习对照组*——不进行练习尝试。

***Retention tests:***All participants performed the five-step movement sequence for five trials two and seven days after the end of the practice sessions.

***保留测试：***练习结束后的两天和七天后，所有被试者都要执行上述的五步动作序列，分别做5次尝试。

***Results:***

***结果：***

*Practice trials:*

*练习尝试：*

No statistically significant difference between the random and blocked practice groups for the mean number of trials required to achieve the perfor­mance criterion.

在达到操作标准所需的平均尝试次数方面，随机练习组和分段练习组之间统计上无显著差异。

*Retention tests:*

*保留测试：*

The *random practice group* performed significantly more successful trials on both retention tests than the blocked practice group and the no-­practice control group.

随机练习组在两次保留测试中的成功尝试次数明显多于分段练习组和无练习对照组。

Interestingly, the blocked practice group did not differ from the no-practice control group on the number of correctly performed trials on the first retention test, but performed significantly better on the second retention test.

令人不解的是在第一次保留测试中，分段练习组与无练习对照组在正确完成的试验的数量上没有区别，但分段练习组在第二次保留测试中的表现明显更好。

***Conclusion:***The experiment demonstrated that it is possible to create the contextual interference effect in a clinical setting by interposing other activities between trials, or repetitions, of the skill or activity ­being rehabilitated. The functional benefit is a longer-lasting performance improvement than would result from repeating repetitions without the intervening ­activities.

***结论：***实验证明，在临床环境中，在旨在康复某项技能或动作的尝试或重复练习之间插入其他动作，有可能产生背景干扰效应。这样做在功能上的好处是比起没有在中间插入其他活动的重复练习，表现水平的提高会会更持久。[!! 翻的非常拗口, 但我一是也想不到更好的 另外在下面提供本段的另外一个译文 但改动就非常之大了]

为了促进某项技能或某个动作的恢复，往往要进行多次尝试或者重复练习。而本实验表明，在这些尝试或重复练习之间插入其他动作，有可能产生背景干扰效应。这样做在功能上的好处是比起没有在中间插入其他活动的重复练习，表现水平的提高会会更持久。

**The Effectiveness of a Moderate Contextual Interference Practice Schedule**

**适度场景干扰练习计划的有效性**

It may be preferable to learn some motor skill variations by practicing according to a schedule that ­involves a moderate rather than a high amount of contextual interference. A study by Landin and Hebert (1997) provides a good example of this type of practice situation.

中等数量背景干扰的练习计划可能比高背景干扰的练习计划更适合去学习某些运动技能的变化形式。Landin 和 Hebert（1997）的研究为这类练习情形提供了一个很好的例子。

Participants were university undergraduate ­students who had very little experience playing basketball. They practiced the one-hand set shot from six positions on the basketball court that varied in angle and distance from the basket. The *low contextual interference* group practiced according to a blocked schedule by shooting six consecutive shots from each position on each of three practice days. The *moderate contextual interference* group followed a blocked-serial schedule by shooting three shots from each position in sequence and then repeating the sequence. The *high contextual interference* group followed a serial schedule by taking one shot from each position in ­sequence and then repeating the sequence six times.

实验中的被试者都是一些没有什么篮球经验的本科生。他们在球场的六个角度和距离各异的位置上练习单手定点投篮。低背景干扰组采用分段练习，三在个练习日中，每天在六个位置上分别进行6次连续的投篮。中等数量背景干扰组采用分段——序列练习，按顺序在六个位置上分别进行3次投篮，然后重复这个顺序再做一次。高背景干扰组采用序列练习，按顺序在六个位置上分别进行1次投篮，然后重复这个顺序做够6次。

On the day after the end of practice, each group performed three transfer tests: a twelve-trial blocked schedule for three of the practice positions; a twelve-trial serial schedule for the same three positions; and a ten-trial free-throw test (the free-throw line was one of the six practiced positions). All three groups ­improved their shooting performance during practice, but they did not differ from each other at the end of practice. However, the blocked-serial practice schedule group performed better than the other two groups on all three tests. In addition, low amounts of contextual interference during practice led to poor adaptation to change. The blocked practice group maintained their end-of‑practice performance level for the blocked and free-throw tests, but their performance on the serial test decreased to the level of their first day of practice.

在练习结束后的第一天，每组进行三项迁移测试：在六个练习位置中选择三个位置分别进行12次按分段安排的投篮测试；在同样三个位置上分别进行12次按序列安排进行的投篮测试；十次罚篮测试（罚篮线是六个练习位置之一）。在练习过程中三个小组的投篮成绩都有提高，但在练习结束时他们各自的投篮成绩之间却没有显著的差异。然而，分段——序列练习组在所有三项测试中的表现都优于其他两组。此外，低背景干扰组在练习过程对变化的适应能力较弱：分段练习组在分段测试和罚篮测试中保持了练习结束时的表现水平，但他们在序列测试中的表现下降到了第一天练习的水平。

1Shea and Zimny (1983) developed a more formal version of the elaboration hypothesis.

**specificity of practice hypothesis** the view that motor skill learning is influenced by practice condition characteristics, especially the sensory/perceptual information available, performance context characteristics, and cognitive processes involved.



**练习特异性假说** 认为运动技能的学习受到练习情境的特征的影响，特别是可获得的感觉/知觉反馈、表现情境特征和练习过程中认知过程的特征。

A study by Jantzen, Steinberg, and Kelso (2005) investigated brain areas involved in the learning and perfor-mance of a rhythmic timing task. Their results demonstrated practice specificity effects by showing a context-dependent network of brain regions activated according to whether a visual or auditory signal guided the practice of a timing task that required movements that were synchronized (in music terms, this means move with the beat) or syncopated (move off the beat) with the signal.

Jantzen、Steinberg 和 Kelso，（2005）的一项研究调查了学习和执行一个有节奏的时机判断任务所涉及到的大脑区域。他们的研究结果通过显示由视觉或听觉信号引导的时机判断任务练习引发的大脑被激活区域中的一个相关场景网络证实了练习特异性的影响，该任务要求动作与信号同步（音乐术语，意思是随节拍移动）或切分（脱离节拍）。

**Brain Region Activity Shows Context Specificity for Learning Rhythmic Timing**

**大脑区域的活动表明学习有节奏的时机判断任务时具有场景特定性**

***The rhythmic timing task:***A visual or auditory metronome paced participants to coordinate index finger and thumb opposition (i.e., moving the index finger to touch the thumb) at a continuous rate of 1.25 movements per second.

**节奏判断任务**：使用视觉或听觉节拍器使受试者以每秒1.25次的速率持续协同食指和拇指的相对位置（即移动食指接触拇指）。

*Visual metronome:*A red dot appeared on a computer monitor

*视觉节拍器：*电脑显示器出现的一个红点

*Auditory metronome:*A tone heard through headphones

*听觉节拍器：*通过耳机听到的声音

*Synchronized movement trials:*Touch the thumb at the same time the signal occurred (continue ­movement at same rhythm after signal stopped; i.e., transfer test)

*同步运动试验：*在信号出现的同时用食指触摸拇指（迁移测试为信号停止后以相同的节奏继续运动）

*Syncopated movement trials:*Touch the thumb ­midway between the signals (continue move­­ment at same rhythm after signal stopped; i.e., transfer test)

*切分运动试验：*在两次信号出现的间期用食指触摸拇指（迁移测试为信号停止后继续以相同的节奏运动）

***Brain activity assessment:***Each participant was placed in a supine position in an MRI scanner, the head fixed with a vacuum pillow. The scanner had fMRI ­capabilities.

***大脑活动评估***：每个受试者呈仰卧姿势安置在具有 fMRI 功能的核磁共振扫描仪下，头部用真空枕头固定。

***Results:***

**结果**:

***Timing performance with and without pacing ­signal:*** Participants achieved the required movement rates for both the synchronized and syncopated coordination modes.

**有无起搏信号的时机判断表现**：受试者在同步和切分模式下都达到了所需的运动速度。

***Brain activity:*** When the visual signal paced ­performance, brain activity involved areas typically involved in the integration of visual and motor information and the translation of visual sensory information into motor output. These ­areas were the middle temporal lobe, bilateral superior parietal lobe, and ventral premotor cortex. What is more interesting is that these ­regions remained active when the participants performed the movements without the ­visual pacing signal present. Activity in these ­areas was ­absent when the auditory signal paced ­performance.

**大脑活动**：当视觉信号决定了表现的速度时，大脑活动涉及的区域通常涉及视觉和运动信息的整合，以及将视觉感觉信息转换为运动输出。这些区域是中颞叶、双侧顶叶上叶和腹侧运动前皮质。更有趣的是当受试者在没有视觉节奏信号的情况下进行运动时，这些区域仍然处于活跃状态。当听觉信号有节奏的出现时，这些区域没有活跃。

***Conclusion:*** The brain activity results support the practice specificity hypothesis proposed by Proteau (e.g., Proteau, 1992) that motor skill learning is specific to the sources of sensory/perceptual information available during practice. Practice with the visual signal activated brain areas specific to visually guided coordination even when the visual signal did not ­appear during the transfer trials.

**结论**：大脑活动的结果支持了Proteau（可参阅，Proteau, 1992）提出的练习特异性假说，即运动技能学习是根据练习过程中可获得的感觉/知觉反馈信息进行的。即使视觉信号在迁移测试中没有出现，但是先前在视觉信号引导下进行的练习还是激活了视觉引导下的手指协同对应的脑区。[!! 这句翻的不好，留待润色。这句的意思是先前在视觉引导下进行手部协同的练习使得完成手部协同练习需要激活的视觉相关的脑区，哪怕在迁移测试中没有视觉信号了，视觉这块的脑区还是被激活了（由于先前的练习）]
