Preface

This twelfth edition primarily updates the previous edition by adding more recent research and interpretations of the concepts and theoretical views associated with those concepts that were in the eleventh edition. Similar to the previous editions this new edition continues its two most distinctive features as an introductory motor learning and control textbook: its overall approach to the study of motor learning and control and the organization of the implementation of that approach. In every edition of this book, the overall approach has been the presentation of motor learning and control “concepts” to identify the common theme of each chapter. The concepts should be viewed as generalized statements and conclusions synthesized from collections of research findings. Following the concept statement is a description of a real-world application of the concept, which is then followed by discussions of specific topics and issues associated with the concept. An important part of these discussions are summaries of research evidence, on which we base our present knowledge of each topic and issue, as well as the implications of this knowledge for practitioners. The benefit of this organizational scheme is the presentation of motor learning and control as a set of principles and guidelines for practitioners, which are based on research evidence 
rather than on tradition or “how things have always been done.”

Our goal for this edition continues to be to provide an introductory study of motor learning and control for students who aspire to become ­practitioners in various professions. As in previous editions, the achievement of this goal involves the inclusion of research examples that demonstrate the evidence-based foundation for the motor learning and control concepts. It is important to note that the research examples are just that—examples; the intent of the discussion of research about a specific topic, therefore, is not to present an extensive review of the research literature or to investigate the various controversial views that may exist 
on a topic.

**NEW TO THIS EDITION**

**New Research**

Because an important goal of this book is to provide research evidence to support the various concepts and applications, it is essential to regularly update the research to maintain the book’s relevance. As in previous editions, each chapter of the twelfth edition includes updated research in the text, the *A Closer Look* boxes, and in the *Related Readings* sections. Research related to motor learning and control continues to increase, as evidenced by the ever-expanding amount of research articles and chapters published each year. Because of the availability of this new information, it is essential that an introductory textbook provide the most up-to-date evidence available to support the numerous concepts and applications that can be derived from this research. But, the caveat here is to not overwhelm the reader with a litany of research studies. It is with this point in mind that we have as a primary intent to present examples of research studies that provide empirical support for the concepts discussed rather than to provide exhaustive reviews of the available research.

**SUCCESSFUL FEATURES**

*Motor Learning and Control: Concepts and Applications* continues to offer the following features from the previous editions that have helped enhance student learning.

**Concepts**

Each chapter begins with a concept statement to present a principle or conclusion that describes the focus of the chapter. The goal of these statements is to provide students a guide for understanding the chapter content, which provides the discussion of issues and research that led to the concept statement.

**Application**

Following the concept statement, the application section describes in practical terms the relevance of the chapter concept and content to everyday experiences and professional practice.** 

**Application Problem to Solve** 

This feature, which follows the application section at the beginning of each chapter, presents a specific application problem for students to work on as they engage in reading the discussion section of the chapter. 

**Discussion**

This section presents the specific information from which the concept statement was derived. It includes the key topics and issues relevant to the chapter concept along with summaries and examples of research that provide evidence to support the various points presented in the chapter.

**A Closer Look Boxes**

Each chapter contains several boxes. The title for each box indicates its content. These boxes typically serve one of several purposes: to provide more detail about a research study than is provided in the text; to describe a situation that applies a point in the discussion to a professional practice situation; or to describe a relevant issue that allows the student to explore a topic beyond the limits of the text.

**Summary**

Each chapter concludes with a summary that presents the main ideas addressed in the discussion section. Using this tool, the student can return easily to a topic in the chapter for clarification or study.

**Points for the Practitioner** 

This feature describes how the chapter topic relates to the practice or performance setting. It encourages students to think about how they will use this information in practical ways.

**Related Readings**

For students who want to know more about a particular topic, this list at the end of each ­chapter offers carefully selected research journal articles, books, and book chapters for further exploration.

**Study Questions**

A set of questions appears at the end of each chapter to encourage students to review and analyze the chapter content.

**Specific Application Problem as a Study Question** 

The final study question presents an application problem to solve as a culminating experience for the student to use the information presented in the chapter. This problem differs from the one located at the beginning of the chapter by describing a situation students might experience in their future professional experience.

**Definition Boxes**

Key terms, which are highlighted in the text in boldface type, are defined in corresponding boxes for easy reference. Other important terms in the text appear in italics for emphasis.

**Lab Links**

The previous four editions included, as part of McGraw-Hill’s Online Learning Center for this book, a laboratory manual of laboratory experiences for most chapters. These experiences are available for this edition as well. In the twelfth edition, these laboratory experiences are identified by “Lab Links” boxes in the margins. 

**Glossary**

At the end of the book, all the key terms defined in the definition boxes are included in a comprehensive glossary. This glossary is useful as a quick reference and a helpful review to prepare for examinations.

**Name Index**

In addition to the regular subject index, this book features a name index, which identifies and locates all the names referred to in the book. Included in this list are the names of important people who have been or are leaders in the field of motor learning and control.

**DIGITAL RESOURCES**

The twelfth edition of *Motor Learning and Control* is now available online with Connect, McGraw-Hill Education’s integrated assignment and assessment platform. Connect also offers SmartBook for the new edition, which is the first adaptive reading experience proven to improve grades and help students study more effectively. All of the title’s website content is also available on Connect, including access to the full course Instructor’s Manual, Test Bank, and PowerPoint slides, and Student Lab Manual.

**ACKNOWLEDGMENTS**

The creation of a new edition of a textbook requires the support of colleagues, friends, and loved ones. Each of us wants to identify specific sources of support, without which we could not have completed this twelfth edition.

Richard wants to acknowledge students and colleagues throughout the world who have told or sent him their ideas and suggestions concerning ways to make the book work better for them in the classes they teach. He greatly appreciates their interest in assisting his efforts to develop this new edition. On a more personal level, he again acknowledges and thanks his wife, Susan Koff, for her support, encouragement, suggestions, and patience. He is dedicating this edition to her for her constancy in “being there.”

David would like to acknowledge support from Alvin Alvarez, Dean of the College of Health and Social Sciences at San Francisco State University, as well as support from the Office of Research and Sponsored Programs. He is indebted to the many colleagues and collaborators from across the world who have inspired his work and shaped his perspective on motor learning and control. Finally, he would like to thank his wife Suzanne and daughter Torre for patiently enduring the many intrusions into “family time” that were necessary to complete this book. David is dedicating the book to his wife, Suzanne Diane Anderson, for her love and the unparalleled personal and professional support she has provided over many, many years.

A new edition of a book would not be possible without the effort and encouragement of the developmental and production editors at McGraw‑Hill. We thank them for their direction, suggestions, and patience. We also thank the many undergraduate and graduate students who have been in our classes. It is difficult to express how much we have learned from them and how they have influenced much of the content of this book.

We also greatly appreciate the feedback from the following reviewers: Rhonda Fleming, 
Limestone College; Dr. Raisbeck, UNCG; Gunars Cazers, University of West Alabama; and Anthony Mayo, San Francisco State University.
