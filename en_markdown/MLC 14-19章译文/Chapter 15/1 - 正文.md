**APPLICATION**

Think about a time when you were beginning to learn a new physical activity. How much success did you experience on your first few attempts? Most likely, you were not very successful. As you practiced, you probably had many questions that you needed someone to answer to help you better understand what you were doing wrong and what you needed to do to improve. Although you may have been able to answer many of your questions on your own as you continued to try different things while you practiced, you found that getting an answer from the instructor saved you time and energy.
设想你刚开始学习某种新的运动技能。在最初的尝试中，你是否成功？很有可能，你并不怎么成功。随着练习的继续，你可能会有许多疑问，需要有人解答这些问题，以便帮助你更好地理解哪些方面你做错了，哪些方面还需要提高。尽管通过练习你自己可能已经解答了大多数问题，但是你会发现从指导者那里获得答案可以节省时间和精力。

This situation is an example of what we discussed in chapter 12 as typical in the early stage of learning a skill, or relearning a skill following an injury or ­illness. The significance of this example is that it points out that an important role played by the practitioner is to give augmented feedback to the learner to facilitate the skill acquisition process.
这就是在第 12 章中讨论过的技能学习早期阶段所发生的典型事件。当个体学习新技能以及损伤或患病后技能的再学习情境中，这些事件同样都很典型。这一事例的意义在于它指出了教师、教练和康复师向学习者提供追加反馈，促进学习过程的重要作用。
Consider the following situations. Suppose that you are teaching a golf swing or fitness activity to a class, helping a new student athletic trainer to tape an ankle, or working in a clinic with a patient learning to walk with an artificial limb. 
思考下面的情境。假设你正在教授一个班级学习高尔夫挥球棒动作，训练一位学生运动训练员包扎脚踝或者帮助使用人造肢体的患者重新学习走路。
In each situation, the people practicing these skills can make many mistakes and will benefit from receiving augmented feedback. When they make mistakes, which they do in abundance when they are beginners, how do you know which mistakes to tell them to correct on subsequent ­attempts? 
尔夫挥球棒动作，或者帮助使用人造肢体的患者重新学习走路。在这两个情境中，个体练习这些技能时通常会犯很多错误，并且将会从获得追加反馈中获利。当他们还是初学者经常犯错误时，你如何知道哪些错误需要指出，并让他们在今后的练习中应予以纠正呢？
If you had a video camera available, would you video them and then let them watch their own performances? Or would it be even more beneficial to take the videos and have them analyzed so that you could show them what their movements looked like kinematically? There are many ways to provide augmented feedback. But before you use any one of these, you should know how to implement that method most effectively and when to use it to facilitate learning.
如果有一架摄像机，你会给他们摄像并让他们观看自己执行的录像，或者将录像带进行分析，让他们知道自己动作的运动学特征是否会更有效吗？提供追加反馈的方式有很多种。但是，作为指导者、教练或康复师使用其中的任何一种方法之前，都应该知道如何有效地实施这一方法、何时使用这种方法能促进学习。

**DISCUSSION**

When people perform a motor skill, they can have avail­able to them *two general types of performance-­related information (i.e., feedback)* that will “tell” ­them something about the outcome of the perfor­mance or about what caused that outcome. 
当个体执行运动技能时，他们可以获得*两大类与执行相关的信息（即反馈）*，这些信息将告诉他们关于执行结果的情况或导致这些结果的原因。
One is **task-­intrinsic feedback,** which is the sensory-perceptual information that is a natural part of performing a skill. Each of our sensory systems can provide this type of feedback. We discussed three of these in chapter 6: touch, proprioception, and vision. 
其中的一类是**任务内在反馈**（task-intrinsic feedback），是任务执行本身带来的感知觉信息。每种感觉系统都可以提供此类反馈。在第 6 章中我们探讨过其中的三种：触觉、本体感觉和视觉。
For example, if a person throws a dart at a target on the wall, he or she receives *visual* task-intrinsic feedback from seeing the flight of the dart and where it lands on the target. In addition, the person receives *tactile and* *proprio­ceptive* task-­intrinsic feedback from the head, trunk, and limbs as he or she prepares and executes the throw. Other sensory systems can also provide task-intrinsic feedback, as does the *auditory* system when the person hears the dart hit, or not hit, the target.
例如，如果个体向墙上的靶子投掷飞镖，他可以看到飞鏢飞行的路线以及飞落在靶子上的位置，这些都是通过*视觉*获得的任务内在反馈。另外个体准备投飞镖以及投出飞镖时，通过*触觉*和*本体感觉*感知身体姿势的改变以及手臂、手的运动，可以获得本体感觉的任务内在反馈。其他的感觉系统也可以提供任务内在反馈，当个体听到飞镖击中或没有击中靶子的声音时，听觉系统就提供了*听觉*形式的任务内在反馈。

The second general type of performance-related information is *in addition to* task-intrinsic feedback. Although various terms have been used to identify this type of feedback (*e.g., external feedback, task-­extrinsic feedback*), the term that will be used in this book is **augmented feedback.** 
第二类与执行技能相关的信息*不同于*任务内在反馈的信息。尽管这类反馈有多种称谓，如*外部反馈*（external feedback）和*任务-外在反馈*（task-­extrinsic feedback），但是本书将使用“**追加反馈**”（augmented feedback）一词。
The adjective “augmented” refers to adding to or enhancing something, which in this case involves *adding to or ­enhancing task-intrinsic feedback.* Augmented feedback *enhances* the task-intrinsic feedback that provides information the person’s sensory system could readily detect on its own, though not necessarily reliably. 
“追加”一词是增加或增强，具体到这里是*增加或增强任务内在反馈*。当追加反馈提供的信息是个体自身感觉系统较易觉察的信息时，追加反馈起到*增强*任务内在反馈的作用。
For example, a teacher or coach might tell a golfer where his or her hands were positioned at the top of the swing, even though proprioceptive feedback would allow the person to feel for himself or herself where they were. In a clinical environment, a therapist might show an amputee ­­­pa­tient EMG traces on a computer monitor to enhance the patient’s own pro­prioceptive feedback to help the patient activate appropriate muscles when learning to operate a prosthetic device.
例如，教练可能告知一位高尔夫运动员在球棒后摆最高点时他手的位置，即使他自己已经知觉到了这些信息。在临床上康复师可能让一个截肢的患者在电脑显示器上观看 EMG 的波形变化，以增强患者自身的本体感觉反馈，帮助其激活相应的肌肉来操作假体。

In other situations, augmented feedback *adds* information that the person cannot detect using his or her sensory system. For example, the golf teacher or coach might tell the golfer where the ball landed because the golfer was concentrating so much on keeping his or her head down during the swing that he or she did not see it after it was hit. 
在其他情境中，追加反馈*增加*个体无法通过自身感觉系统获得的信息。例如，高尔夫教师或教练可以告诉高尔夫球手球去了哪里，因为高尔夫球手专注于摆臂时头向下，击球后就看不到球了。
Likewise, a therapist might tell a patient how much his or her body swayed ­because vestibular problems prevent the ­patient from being able to detect this information. In each of these situations, augmented feedback provides performance information that otherwise would not be available to the person.
同样，康复师可以告诉患者其身体摇摆的程度，因为前庭的问题使患者不能觉察这些信息。在这些情境中，追加反馈提供的信息是个体自身无法获得的信息。

**THE FEEDBACK FAMILY**
**反馈家族**

Note that the term *feedback* is common to both ­categories of performance-related information described in the preceding paragraphs. As a result, it is important to consider the term “feedback” as a generic term that describes information people receive about their performance of a motor skill during or after the performance. 
*反馈*（feedback）是任务内在反馈和追加反馈的统称。因此，反馈作为一个上位概念，是指个体在练习期间或练习后获得的，关于运动技能执行的信息。
To help con­ceptualize the relationship between the two general types of performance-related feedback, consider these two types of feedback as related members of the same family. Figure 15.1 graphically describes the feedback family relationships for task-intrinsic feedback and augmented feedback, as well as for the related specific types of each.
为了便于理解任务内在反馈和追加反馈之间的关系，下面介绍一下反馈家族。图 15.1 描述了反馈家族中任务内在反馈与追加反馈的关系，以及者两类反馈所包含的其他反馈。

**TYPES OF AUGMENTED FEEDBACK**
**追加反馈的类型**

In figure 15.1, note that there are *two categories of augmented feedback:* *knowledge of results* and *knowledge of performance.* Each category can involve a variety of ways of presenting augmented feedback; this will be the topic of discussion later in this chapter.
在图 15.1 中，标注有*两类追加反馈*：*结果反馈*（knowledge of results）和*操作反馈*（knowledge of performance）。这两类追加反馈又包括有不同的呈现方式，这一点将在后面的章节中探讨。

**Knowledge of Results (KR)**
**结果反馈（KR）**

The category of augmented feedback known as **knowledge of results** (commonly referred to as **KR**) consists of *externally presented information about the outcome (result) of an attempt to perform a skill.* For example, if a teacher tells a student in an archery class, “The shot was in the blue 
at 9 o’clock,” the teacher is providing performance outcome information. Similarly, a therapist may provide a patient with a computer-generated graph indicating how close he came to achieving a target range of motion during hip internal rotation.
广为人知的一类追加反馈是*结果反馈*（**KR**），主要是以*技能执行结果或是否达到操作目标为内容的外部的信息*。在一些情境中，KR 描述的是个体的执行结果。例如，教师告诉射箭班的一位学生：“射中了蓝色 9 环。”此时教师提供的就是执行结果。同样，治疗师可以向患者提供计算机生成的图像，该图显示他在髋关节内旋期间离目标运动范围有多近。

Sometimes, KR simply tells the performer *whether he or she has achieved the performance goal.* This is the case when some external device gives a “yes” or “no” signal indicating whether or not the performance goal was achieved. For example, to augment proprioceptive and visual feedback for a patient working on achieving a specific amount of knee extension, the therapist could set a buzzer to be activated when the patient achieved the goal number of degrees of movement. Although the buzzer would provide no information about how close to the goal the movement was if it had not been achieved, the patient would know that he or she had not achieved the goal unless the buzzer sounded. There are some additional examples of KR in table 15.1.
有时，KR 并没有描述执行结果，而是简单地告知*执行者是否达到操作目标*。外部的一些仪器通过给出“是”或“否”来显示是否达到操作目标，就属于这种情况。例如，向练习腿部伸展的患者提供追加的本体感觉和视觉反馈，康复师可以设置一个蜂鸣器，在患者达到运动目标时鸣响。即使患者没有达到目标时，蜂鸣器也无法告诉他与目标相差的远近程度，但是患者将知道他没有达到目标。见表 15.1 中还列举了其他的一些例子。

It is important to point out that we are using the term *KR* to refer to one type of augmented feedback. Although a person can obtain knowledge about the results of an action from his or her own sensory system, such as seeing whether the basketball mis­sed the basket or went in, this type of perfor­mance-related information is task-intrinsic. It does not refer to the specific type of performance-related ­information that the term *KR* refers to in this text. The importance of this distinction is that it allows us to distinguish the specific influences of task-intrinsic and augmented feedback on skill learning.
有必要指出 *KR* 只是追加反馈中的一种。尽管个体可以通过自身的感觉系统获得关于动作结果的信息，例如，看到篮球是否进入篮框。但是，这些与执行相关的信息是任务内在的，只要执行任务就能获得。本书中 *KR* 并未指代某种特定类型的任务执行相关信息。这样做的重要性在于可以帮助我们区分任务内在反馈和追加反馈对运动技能学习的影响。

**Knowledge of Performance (KP)**
**操作反馈（KP）**

The second category of augmented feedback is **knowledge of performance** (known as **KP**). This is information about the *movement characteristics that led to the performance outcome.* The important point here is that KP differs from KR in terms of which aspect of performance the information refers to. For example, in the archery situation described earlier, the teacher could provide KP by telling the student that he or she pulled the bow to the left at the release of the arrow. Here, the teacher augments the task-intrinsic feedback by telling the student what he or she did that caused the arrow to hit the target where it did.
第二类追加反馈是操作反馈（KP）。KP 是关于*动作特征*的信息。KP 与 KR 的区别在于两者分别提供不同方面的信息。例如，在射箭情境中，教师通过告诉学生“放箭的时候拉弓偏左”来提供 KP。此时，教师通过告诉学生哪些动作特征导致了当前的运动结果，从而追加了任务内在反馈。

In addition to giving KP verbally, there are various nonverbal means of providing KP. For example, the instructor may move the learner’s body part through the actual movement trajectory, as a form of “manual guidance” that would allow the learner to “feel” the correct movement. Another example of nonverbal KP is video replay, which is a popular method of showing a person what he or she did while performing a skill. Video replay allows the person to see what he or ­she actually did that led to the outcome of that perfor­mance. Although video replay can show a ­performance outcome, it is commonly used as KP. Another means of providing KP that is increasing in popularity as computer software becomes more accessible is showing the person ­computer-generated kinematic characteristics of the just-completed ­per­formance. In clinical environments, therapists also use biofeedback devices to give KP. For example, a therapist can attach a buzzer to an EMG recording device so that the person hears the buzzer sound when he or she activates the appropriate muscle during the performance of an action. In each of these situations, sensory feedback is augmented in a way that informs the person about the movement characteristics associated with the outcome of an action.
除了提供言语形式的 KP 外，还可以用多种非言语的手段提供 KP。例如，指导者可以按照正确的运动轨迹移动学习者的身体部分，作为一种“手动指导”的形式，可以帮助学习者“感觉”正确的运动。另一种方法是播放录像，可以用于展示个体执行技能的动作。录像播放可以使个体明白是什么动作导致了当前的操作结果。随着电脑软件的发展，还有一种提供 KP 的方式正逐渐变得普及，就是用电脑显示个体执行动作的运动学特征。在临床情境中，康复师还可以使用生物反馈仪来提供 KP。例如，康复师可以在肌电仪上接一个蜂鸣器，当患者激活对应的肌肉时蜂鸣器鸣响。在以上的各情境中，通过提示执行者与运动结果相关的运动特征，增强了任务内在感觉反馈。

**THE ROLES OF AUGMENTED FEEDBACK IN SKILL ACQUISITION**
**追加反馈在技能获得中的作用**

Augmented feedback plays two roles in the skill learning process. One is to *facilitate achievement of the action goal of the skill.* Because augmented feedback provides information about the success of the skill in progress or just completed, the learner can determine whether what he or she is doing is appropriate for performing the skill correctly. Thus, the augmented feedback can help the person achieve the skill goal more quickly or more easily than he or she could without this external information.
追加反馈在运动技能学习过程中起着两种作用。一种是*促进动作目标的获得*。因为追加反馈提供关于技能执行成功程度的信息，所以学习者能够确定适宜的活动内容，以便正确执行技能。这样，与不获得任何外部信息相比，追加反馈可以帮助个体更快更容易地达到技能目标。

The second role played by augmented feedback is to *motivate the learner to continue striving toward a goal.* In this role, the person uses augmented feedback to compare his or her own performance to a performance goal. The person then must decide to continue trying to achieve that goal, to change goals, or to stop performing the activity. This motivational role of augmented feedback is not the ­focus of our discussion here. Others, however, have discussed it in the motor learning literature (e.g., Little & McCullagh, 1989; Wulf & Lewthwaite, 2016; Wulf, Shea, & Lewthwaite, 2010). Scholars interested in the ­pedagogical aspects of ­physical education teaching (e.g., Silverman, Woods, & Subramaniam, 1998; Solmon, 2015; Solmon & Lee, 1996) increasingly are studying the effects of augmented feedback on ­people’s motivation to engage in, or continue to ­engage in, physical ac­tivities. In addition, augmented feedback functions as an important factor in influencing students’ per­cep­tions of ability (e.g., Fredenberg, Lee, & Solmon, 2001). And exercise psychologists have shown that augmented feedback is influential in motivating peo­ple to adhere to exercise and rehabilitation ­programs (e.g., Annesi, 1998; Dishman, 1993; Shakudo et al., 2011).
追加反馈的第二种作用是*激励学习者向目标持续努力*。此时，执行者通过追加反馈将自己的执行情况与目标进行比较，然后再决策是继续向目标努力、改变目标还是停止执行活动。追加反馈的这种动机作用并不是本章讨论的重点。然而，另外一些研究者在运动技能学习文献中详细地探讨了追加反馈的动机作用（例如，Little & McCullagh, 1989; Wulf & Lewthwaite, 2016; Wulf, Shea, & Lewthwaite, 2010)。对体育教学问题（Silverman, Woods, & Subramaniam, 1998; Solmon, 2015; Solmon & Lee, 1996) 感兴趣的学者更多地研究追加反馈对个体参与或坚持体育活动动机的影响。此外，追加反馈同时也是影响学生自我效能的重要因素（例如，Fredenberg, Lee, & Solmon, 2001)。并且，锻炼心理学家揭示了追加反馈影响个体参与锻炼、康复程序的持续性（例如，Annesi, 1998; Dishman, 1993; Shakudo et al., 2011)。

**HOW ESSENTIAL IS AUGMENTED FEEDBACK FOR SKILL ACQUISITION?**
**追加反馈在运动技能获得过程中的必要程度**

When a researcher or practitioner considers the use of augmented feedback to facilitate skill acquisition, an important theoretical and practical question arises: *Is augmented feedback necessary for a person to learn motor skills?* The answer to this question has theoretical implications for the under­­­­standing of the nature of skill learning itself. The need, or lack of need, for augmented feedback to acquire motor skills tells us much about what characterizes the human learning system and how it functions to ­acquire new skills. From a practical perspective, determining the necessity for augmented feedback for skill learning can serve to guide the development and implementation of effective instructional strategies. As you will see, the answer to this question is not a simple yes or no. Instead, there are *four different answers.* Which one is appropriate depends on certain characteristics of the skill being learned and of the person learning the skill.
当研究者或相关从业人员思考如何使用追加反馈来促进技能的习得时，会有一个在理论和实上都很重要的践问题，即*追加反馈是否是个体学习运动技能的必要条件*？回答这一问题对理解运动技能学习本质具有重要的意义。运动技能获得中是否需要追加反馈，可以告诉我们很多关于人类学习系统特点及其运作机制的信息。从实践的角度讲，可以为形成和实施有效的教学策略提供指导。正如你将看到的，对这一问题的回答并不是简单的“是”或“否”。事实上，有*四种不同的答案*。究竟起到何种作用，还取决于技能学习情境以及学习个体的特征。

**Augmented Feedback Can Be Essential for Skill Acquisition**
**追加反馈可以是运动技能学习的必备条件**

In some skill learning situations, people, for various reasons, cannot use the task-intrinsic feedback to determine what they need to do to improve ­per­formance. As a result, augmented feedback is essential for learning. The following three types of situations describe when a person may *not* be able to use important task-intrinsic feedback effectively.
在一些运动技能学习的情境中，个体由于多种原因无法使用任务内在反馈来确定活动内容。因此，追加反馈对于运动技能学习就是必不可少的。至少在以下三种情境中，个体*无法*有效地使用任务内在反馈信息。

*First,* *some skill performance contexts do not make critical sensory feedback available to the ­person*. For example, when a performer cannot see a target that he or she must hit, the performer does not have important visual feedback available. In this case, augmented feedback provides critical information that is not available from the task perfor­mance environment itself.
*第一，个体不能获得关键的感觉反馈。*例如，当无法看到所要击打的目标时，执行者不能获得重要的视觉反馈。此时，追加反馈追加了从任务执行环境中无法获得的关键信息。

*Second, because of injury, disease, and the like, the person does not have available the sensory pathways needed to detect task-intrinsic feedback* for the skill he or she is learning. For these ­people, augmented feedback provides this missing information.
*第二，个体由于损伤、疾病等不能从感觉通路中觉察任务内在的反馈信息。* 对于这些个体，追加反馈起到了替代缺失信息的作用。

*Third,* in some situations the appropriate task-­intrinsic feedback *provides the necessary information and the person’s sensory system is capable of detecting it, but the person cannot use the feedback*. For example, a person learning to extend a knee a certain distance or to throw a ball at a certain rate of speed may not be able to determine the distance moved or the rate of speed of the throw because of lack of experience. In these situations, augmented feedback can make the available task-intrinsic feedback more meaningful to the performer.
*第三*，任务内在反馈可以提供必要的信息，而且个体的感觉系统也能够觉察到这些信息，但是，*个体确无法运用这些反馈信息*。例如，当学习将肢体移动一定的距离或以一定的速度抛球等任务时，个体由于缺乏经验，不能确定移动的距离或投掷的速度。此时，追加反馈帮助个体理解任务内在反馈的含义。

**Augmented Feedback May Not Be Needed for Skill Acquisition**
**技能习得也可能不需要追加反馈**

Some motor skills *inherently provide sufficient task-intrinsic feedback,* so augmented feedback is redundant. For these types of skills, learners can use their own sensory feedback systems to determine the ­­­ap­p­ropriateness of their movements and make adjustments on future attempts. An experiment by Magill, Chamberlin, and Hall (1991) provides a labora­tory example of this type of situation. Participants learned a coincidence-anticipation skill in which they simulated striking a moving object, which was a series of LEDs sequentially lighting along a 281 cm long trackway. As they faced the trackway, they had to use a handheld bat to knock down a small wooden barrier directly under a target LED coincident with the lighting of the target. KR was the number of msec that they contacted the ­barrier before or after the target lighted. Four experiments showed that participants learned this task regardless of the number of trials on which they received KR during practice. In fact, receiving KR during practice did not lead to better learning than practice without KR. It is important to note that these results were replicated in an experiment reported by Coker (2006).
有些运动技能*本身提供了丰富的任务内在反馈*，所以追加反馈是多余的。对于这些技能，学习者可以使用他们自己的感觉系统来确定动作的恰当性，及时地进行动作的调整。Magill、Chamberlin 和 Hall（1991）提供了此类情境的实验室研究实例。被试学习一致性时机任务（coincidence-anticipation skill），模拟击打某运动物体，即 281 厘米轨道上依次点亮的一系列 LED。当个体面对轨道时，他们必须在目标 LED 点亮的同时用手握拍子击倒该 LED 正下方的木制障碍。KR 是个体接触障碍与目标点亮之间相差的毫秒数。4 个实验显示，无论个体在练习中获得 KR 次数的多少，被试都习得了这一技能。事实上，与不提供 KR 相比，在练习期间提供 KR 并没有导致更好的学习效果。这些结果在 Coker （2006）报告的一项实验中也得到了复现。

A motor skill that does not require augmented feedback to learn it has an important characteristic: *a detectable external referent* in the environment that the person can use to determine the ­appropriateness of an action. For the anticipation timing task in the Magill et al. experiment, the target and other LEDs were the external referents. The learner could see when the bat made contact with the barrier in comparison to when the target LED lighted; this enabled him or her to see the relationship between his or her own movements and the goal of those movements. It is important to note here that the learner may *not* be consciously aware of this relationship. The sensory system and the ­motor control system operate in these situations in a way that does not demand the person’s conscious awareness of the environmental characteristics (see Magill, 1998). Thus, the enhancement of these characteristics by providing augmented feedback does not increase or speed up learning of the skill.
在技能获得中，不一定需要追加反馈的运动情境具有一个重要的特征：*在环境中存在一个可以觉察的外部参照*，个体可以通过这一参照来确定动作的恰当性。对于 Magill 等人的一致性时机任务，目标和其他 LED 就是外部参照。学习者可以看到用球拍击中障碍与目标 LED 点亮之间的差异，这使个体知道他们自身运动与目标运动之间的关系。这里需要注意个体可能*并不会*意识到这种关系。在这些情境中，感觉系统和运动控制系统的运作都已不需要个体有意识地知觉环境的特点（Magill, 1998)。因此，通过提供追加反馈增强这些环境特征不会提高学习水平或加快学习速度。

Practice condition characteristics also influence the need for augmented feedback. One of these characteristics is the existence of an observational learning situation, which we discussed in chap­ter 14. Two different types of observational learning ­situations can be influential. In one, the learner ­ob­serves a skilled model perform the skill. For ­example, in an experiment by Magill and Schoenfelder-Zohdi (1996), people who observed a skilled demonstra­tion learned a rhythmic gymnastics rope skill as well as those who received verbal KP after each trial. In the other situation, the learner observes other ­beginners practice. For example, Hebert and Landin (1994) showed that beginning tennis players who watched other beginners practice learned the tennis forehand volley as well as or better than beginning players who received verbal KP. In both of these situations, beginners were able to practice and improve without augmented feedback. It is interesting to note that similar effects were found by Xeroulis and colleagues (2007) for medical students learning suturing and knot-tying skills for surgery.
练习条件的特征也影响着运动技能学习对追加反馈的需求。其中一个特征就是存在第 14 章中讨论过的观察学习情境。有两类观察学习情境可以产生这种影响。第一类是，学习者观察熟练示范者执行技能。例如，Magill 和 Schoenfelder-Zohdi（1996） 的实验显示，观察熟练示范组与每次练习后获得 KP 组在韵律体操绳任务的学习效果相当。在另外一种情境中，学习者观察其他初学者的练习。例如，Hebert 和 Landin（1994）显示，观察其他网球初学者的练习组在网球正手截击球任务中的绩效与获得言语 KP 组相当，或好于后者。在这两种情境中，初学者不获得追加反馈仍能够练习和提高技能。值得注意的是，Xeroulis 和他的同事（2007）在学习手术缝合和打结技能的医学生中也发现了类似的效果。

There is an interesting parallel between skill learning situations in which learners do not need augmented feedback and results of studies investi­gating the use of teacher feedback in physical education class settings. These studies consistently have shown low correlations for the relationship between teacher feedback and student achievement (e.g., Lee, Keh, & Magill, 1993; Silverman, Tyson, & Krampitz, 1991). This finding suggests that the amount and quality of teacher feedback is influential for improving the skills of beginners in sport skills class ­settings, but we should not see it as the most important variable. Other variables, such as opportunities for observational learning or the clarity of task-intrinsic feedback, appear to be capable of precluding the need for augmented feedback. Our understanding of the extent of these influences awaits further research.
学习者不需要追加反馈的技能学习情境和在体育教学情境中教师反馈与学习效果关系的研究之间存在着有趣的相似之处。这些研究一致地显示教师反馈与学生学习效果之间存在低相关（例如，Lee, Keh, & Magill, 1993; Silverman, Tyson, & Krampitz, 1991)。这些结果提示，在运动技能教学情境中，教师反馈的数量和质量影响初学者技能的提高，但是，我们不应该把其视为最重要的因素。其他因素，如存在观察学习或任务内在反馈足够清晰，似乎会导致不需要追加反馈。总之，我们对追加反馈作用的认识和理解有待进一步研究。

**Augmented Feedback Can Enhance Skill Acquisition**
**追加反馈可以促进技能的习得**

There are some types of motor skills that people can learn without augmented feedback, but they will *learn them more quickly or perform them at a higher level* if they receive augmented feedback during practice. For these skills, augmented feedback is neither essential nor redundant. Instead, it *enhances the learning of these skills beyond what could be achieved without augmented feedback.*
虽然不需要提供追加反馈个体就能够学会某些运动技能，但是如果在练习中提供追加反馈，可以使个体*更快地掌握这些技能或者是表现出更高水平*。对于这些技能来说，追加反馈既不是必不可少的，也不是多余无用的。相反，提供追加反馈可以*促进这些技能的学习，使其达到更高的水平*。

Skills in this category include those for which improvement does occur through task-intrinsic feed­back alone, but because of certain skill or learner characteristics, performance improvement reaches only a certain level. One type of skill that fits this description consists of relatively simple skills for which achievement of the performance goal is initially easy to attain. An example is a movement goal of moving as quickly as possible. Initially, a person can assess if a particular attempt was faster than a previous one. However, improvement seems to stop at a certain level of performance usually because the learner’s lack of experience results in his or her decreased capability to discriminate small movement-speed differences. To improve beyond this level of performance, the person requires augmented feedback.
此类技能包括依靠任务内在反馈完全可以学习或提高的技能，但是，由于技能或学习者的一些特征，操作水平只能提高到某一程度。相对简单的、操作目标容易实现的技能就属于此类情况。例如，运动目标是尽可能快地移动。一开始，如果有些练习比前面的练习快，个体可以判断是否达到“尽快”的目标。但是，通常由于学习者缺乏经验，个体区分微量运动速度差异的能力较差，提高似乎停留在某一水平上。为了突破这一水平，个体需要追加反馈。

Another type of skill for which augmented feedback enhances learning is any complex skill that ­requires a person to acquire an appropriate multi­limb pattern of coordination. For such skills, learners can attain a certain degree of success simply by making repeated attempts to achieve the perfor­mance goal. But this goal achievement process can be speeded up with the addition of KP. More specifically, the KP that works best is information about critical components of the coordination pattern.
追加反馈可以促进新协调模式复杂运动技能的学习。对于这些技能来说，重复练习可以使操作水平提高到一定的水平。但是，提供 KP 可以加速达到目标的进程。提供协调模式关键信息的 KP 尤为有效。

The best research example of this type of skill is an experiment by Wallace and Hagler (1979). Participants learned a one-hand basketball set shot with the nondominant hand, from a distance of 3.03 m from the basket, and 45° to the left side of the basket. After each shot, one group received verbal KP about errors in their stance and limb move­ments during the shot. Another group received only verbal ­encour­agement after each shot. Both groups could see the outcome of each shot. Figure 15.2 depicts ­the results. Note that KP provided an initial boost in ­perfor­mance for the first fifteen trials. Then, the verbal encouragement group caught up. However, similarity in performance between the two groups lasted only about ten trials; after this point, the verbal encouragement group showed no further improvement, whereas the group receiving KP continued to improve.
关于此类技能的最好研究实例是 Wallace 和 Hagler（1979） 的实验。受试者站在距篮框 3.03 米，与篮框左侧呈 45 度角的地方，学习用非优势手单手投篮的任务。每次投篮后，一组获得关于姿态和肢体运动错误的语言 KP。另一组在每次练习后仅获得言语鼓励。这两组被试都可以看到每次投篮的结果。图 15.2 显示了这一结果。注意在前 15 次练习中 KP 带来了水平最初的进步。之后，言语鼓励组追赶了上来。然而，这两组之间的相似性仅持续了 10 次练习；此后，言语鼓励组没有表现出进一步的提高，而 KP 组则继续提高。

**Augmented Feedback Can Hinder Skill Learning**
**追加反馈可以阻碍运动技能的学习**

An effect of augmented feedback on skill learning that many might not expect is that it can hinder the learning process and, in some cases, actually make learning worse than it would have been otherwise. This effect is especially evident when a beginning learner becomes *dependent on augmented feedback that will not be available in a test situation*. Typically, the performance improvement the learner experienced during practice deteriorates in the test situation. In fact, in some situations, not only does per­­for­mance deteriorate when augmented feedback is withdrawn, but the test performance is no better than if augmented feedback had not been given at all.
多数人不希望看到的一种结果是追加反馈阻碍运动技能学习，并且有时会使学习变得更糟。当初学者*依赖于追加反馈，而测试中不提供追加反馈时*，这一效果更加明显。通常，学习者在练习中表现出的水平提高，在测试中会出现逆转。事实上，在一些情境中，不仅是不提供追加反馈时水平下降，而且测试表现可能还不如无追加反馈组。

Dependence on augmented feedback is most likely to occur when task-intrinsic feedback is minimal or difficult to detect or interpret. In this situation, people typically substitute augmented feedback for task-intrinsic feedback because it gives them an easy-to-use guide for performing correctly.
任务内在反馈较少或较难解释时，最可能导致个体对追加反馈的依赖。当执行此类技能时，个体通常用追加反馈来代替任务内在反馈，因为追加反馈为个体提供了一种正确执行动作的简单易用的指导。

Several types of situations can lead a person to become dependent on augmented feedback. We will discuss three later in this chapter. One involves the presentation of *erroneous augmented feedback*. Another situation involves the presentation of *concurrent augmented feedback,* which refers to giving augmented feedback while a person performs a skill. The third occurs when *augmented feedback is given too frequently during practice*.
有几种情境可以使个体依赖追加反馈，本章将讨论其中的三种情境：一种是提供*错误的追加反馈*；另一种是提供*同步追加反馈*，即个体执行技能的同时提供追加反馈；第三种是练习中*过于频繁地提供追加反馈*。

**THE CONTENT OF AUGMENTED FEEDBACK**
**追加反馈的内容**

In this section, we focus on important issues concerning the content of augmented feedback, and then examine several types of augmented ­feedback that practitioners can use. We consider five ­issues related to the content of augmented feedback. Each of these concerns some of the kinds of information augmented feedback may contain.
在本节中，我们将探讨追加反馈的内容这一重要议题，之后介绍几种从业人员可以使用的追加反馈。我们将考虑 5 个与追加反馈内容相关的问题。每个问题都与追加反馈携带的信息有关。

**Information about Errors versus Correct Aspects of Performance**
**关于执行正确性的信息**

An often debated issue about augmented feedback content is whether the information should refer to the mistakes made or those aspects of the performance that are correct. Research consistently has shown that *error information is more effective for ­facilitating skill learning,* especially in terms of persistence of learning and transfer capability. This evidence supports an important hypothesis, that focusing on what is done correctly while learning a skill, especially in the early stage of learning, is not sufficient by itself to produce optimal learning. Rather, the experience the person has in correcting errors by ­operating on error-based augmented feedback is especially important during skill acquisition to enhance future ­performance of the skill in different environments and situations, as well as to enhance the capability to self-correct errors while performing the skill.
关于追加反馈内容常引起争论的一个问题是指导者传递给学习者的信息应该指向执行中出现的错误，还是执行中正确的部分？研究证据一致地显示，*错误信息更能促进运动技能的提高*。这些证据支持了一个重要的假说，即运动技能学习过程中，尤其是在学习早期阶段，个体只知道做对了什么，是不足以产生最佳学习效果的。相反，个体在含有执行错误信息的追加反馈基础上，不断纠正错误的经历对于运动技能习得是至关重要的，还可以增强未来该技能在不同环境和情况下的表现，以及增强在执行该技能时自我纠错的能力。

Another way of looking at this issue is to consider the different roles augmented feedback plays. Error information directs a person to change certain performance characteristics; this in turn facilitates skill acquisition. On the other hand, in­­­for­mation indicating that the person performed certain characteristics correctly tells the person that he or she is on track in learning the skill and encourages the person to keep trying. When we consider augmented feedback from this perspective, we see that whether this feedback should be about errors or about correct aspects of performance ­depends on the goal of the information. Error-related information works better to facilitate skill acquisition, whereas information about correct performance serves better to motivate the person to continue. Although some researchers have argued that information about correct performance has a direct effect on learning (Chiviacowsky & Wulf, 2007; Wulf et al., 2010), the primary role for information about correct performance as augmented feedback is motivational. In addition, evidence to support this contention was provided in a study by Carter, Smith, and Ste-Marie (2016), in which augmented feedback provided after “good” performance trials had a positive effect on learners’ judgments about their own learning of a skill (i.e., meta-cognition).
探讨这一问题的另一种角度是思考追加反馈在运动技能学习中的不同作用。一方面，错误信息指引个体改变执行特征，因此利于技能的获得；另一方面，正确执行的信息告诉学习者，他们正在向着绩效目标进步，并能鼓励个体继续努力。当我们从这一视角思考时，看到应该提供错误执行信息还是正确执行的信息，完全取决于提供信息的目的。与执行错误相关的信息更能促进技能的获得，而正确执行的信息更多地起到激励个体持续努力的作用。尽管一些研究人员认为关于正确表现的信息对学习有直接影响（Chiviacowsky & Wulf, 2007; Wulf et al., 2010），但关于正确表现的信息作为增强反馈的主要还是起激励作用。此外，Carter、Smith 和 Ste-Marie （2016）的一项研究提供了支持这一论点的证据，其中在“良好”表现后提供的增强反馈对学习者对自己技能学习情况的判断（即元认知）有积极影响。

**KR versus KP**
**KR 还是 KP**

Two relevant questions concerning the comparison of the use of KR and KP in skill learning situations are these: Do practitioners use one of these forms of augmented feedback more than the other? Do they influence skill learning in similar or different ways?
在运动技能学习情境中，经常用于比较 KR 和 KP 的两个方面是：练习者更倾向于使用 KR 还是 KP？两者对运动技能学习的影响是否相同？

Most of the evidence addressing the first question comes from the study of physical education teachers in actual class situations. The best example is a study by Fishman and Tobey (1978). Although their study was conducted many years ago, it is ­representative of more recent studies, and it involves the most extensive sampling of teachers and classes of any study that has investigated this question. Fishman and Tobey observed teachers in eighty-one classes teaching a variety of physical ­activities. The results showed that the teachers overwhelmingly gave KP (94 percent of the time) more than KR.
大多数来自体育教学情境的研究探讨了第一个问题。Fishman 和 Tobey（1978）的研究是一个较好的实例。尽管这是多年以前的研究，但是，它更具有代表性，因为是其他同类研究中样本量最大的一个实验研究。Fishman 和 Tobey观察了教授不同体育活动的 81 个班的教师。结果显示，教师绝大多数时间都使用 KP (94%的课堂时间），而不是 KR。

An answer to the second question, concerning the relative effectiveness of KR and KP, is more ­difficult to provide because of the lack of sufficient and conclusive evidence from research investigating this question. The following examples of experiments provide some insight into a reasonable answer.
第二个关于 KR 和 KP 效用的问题，由于缺乏足够的研究证据还较难证实。下面的研究实例为我们提供了探讨这一问题的思路。

Two of the experiments suggest that KP is better than KR to facilitate motor skill learning. Kernodle and Carlton (1992) compared KR with videotape ­replays and verbally presented technique statements as KP in an experiment in which participants practiced throwing a soft, spongy ball as far as possible with the nondominant arm. KR was presented as the distance of the throw for each practice trial. The results showed that KP led to better throwing technique and distance than KR. Zubiaur, O–a, and ­Delgado (1999) made a similar conclusion in a study in which university students with no previous volleyball experience practiced the overhead serve in volleyball. KP was specific information about the most important error to correct as it related to action ­either before hitting or in hitting the ball. KR referred to the outcome of the hit in terms of the ball’s spatial precision, rotation, and flight. The results indicated that KP was more influential for learning the serve.
有两个实验研究显示 KP 比 KR 更利于运动技能的学习。Kernodle 和 Carlton（1992）在用非优势手向远处投软球的实验中，比较了 KR、录像播放和用言语描述技术动作的 KP。KR 是每次投掷的距离。结果显示，KP 导致比 KR 更好的技术动作和更远的投掷距离。Zubiaur 、O-a 和 Delgado （1999） 在前期无经验的大学生练习排球上手发球的实验中，报告了相似的研究结果。KP 是关于击球前（或后）动作是否正确的特定信息。KR 则是根据球的空间准确性、旋转和飞行给出的击球结果。结果显示 KP 更利于发球动作的学习。

However, a study by Silverman, Woods, and ­Subramaniam (1999) provided evidence for the benefit of both KR and KP in terms of how each related to how often students in physical education classes would engage in successful and unsuccessful practice trials during a class. They observed eight middle school teachers teaching two classes each in various sport-related activities. The results indicated that teacher feedback as KR and as KP showed relatively high correlations with the frequency of students engaging in successful practice trials (.64 and .67, respectively).
然而，Silverman 、Woods 和 Subramaniam （1999）的研究显示，根据 KR、KP 与学生在一次体育课上成功、失败练习次数的相关性，KR 和 KP 对个体的学习同样有效。他们观察了 8 名中学体育教师，每位教师分别在两个班教授不同的体育活动。结果显示，以 KR 和 KP 形式提供的教师反馈与学生成功练习的频率之间，呈现相对较高的相关性（分别是 0.64 和 0.67）。

These studies indicate that *both KR and KP can be valuable* for skill learning. Consider some conditions in which each of these forms of augmented feedback would be beneficial. *KR will be beneficial for skill learning* for at least five reasons: (1) Learners often use KR to confirm their own assessments of the task-intrinsic feedback, even though it may be redundant with task-intrinsic feedback. (2) Learners may need KR because they cannot determine the outcome of performing a skill on the basis of the available task-intrinsic feedback. (3) Learners often use KR to motivate themselves to continue practicing the skill. (4) Providing only KR may help to establish a discovery learning practice environment in which learners are encouraged to engage in trial-and-error problem-solving activity as they acquire a skill. (5) Providing only KR may help to ensure that learners adopt an external focus of attention as they practice a skill. (See Wulf, Chiviacowsky, Schiller, & çvila, 2010, for a discussion of the potential benefits of using augmented feedback to induce an external focus of attention during practice.)
这些研究显示在运动技能学习情境中，*KR 和 KP 都有价值*。在此前提下，试想这两种追加反馈形式利于学习的原因。*KR 利于运动技能的学习至少有以下五个原因*：①学习者经常用 KR 来验证他们对任务内在反馈的评价，尽管相对于任务内在反馈来说 KR 有可能是多余的；②学习者可能需要 KR，因为他们根据已经获得的任务内在反馈，无法确定技能执行结果的正确性；③学习者经常用 KR 激励自己继续练习技能；④主试为了建立一种发现学习的习情境，可能只提供 KR，这样会激励学习者通过反复试错这一基本手段习得技能。（5）只提供 KR 有助于确保学习者在练习技能的时建立起外部注意。（关于在实践中使用追加反馈促进外部注意力的潜在好处，见 Wulf, Chiviacowsky, Schiller, & çvila, 2010）

On the other hand, *KP can be especially beneficial* when (1) skills must be performed according to specified movement characteristics, such as gymnastics stunts, springboard dives or ballet movements; (2) specific movement components of skills that require complex coordination must be improved or corrected; (3) the goal of the action is to produce a specific kinematic, kinetic, or muscle activity profile; (4) KR is redundant with the task-intrinsic feedback.
另一方面，KP 更利于以下运动技能的学习：①技能必须根据具体的运动特征执行，如体操技巧和跳板跳水；②复杂协调模式的技能需要提高或纠正；③动作目标是运动学、动力学或是特定的肌肉活动；④相对于任务内在反馈，KR 是多余的。

It is important to note here that the discussion of KR and KP suggests that performance errors are part of learning motor skills. This role for errors was discussed as part of a series of five experiments in a study by Lee and his colleagues (Lee et al., 2016). In this research the authors found no support for practice conditions that promote errorless learning. Errors during practice enhanced the motor learning process.
这里需要注意的是，对 KR 和 KP 的讨论表明，表现错误是学习运动技能的一部分。Lee 和他的同事在一项研究中（Lee et al., 2016）讨论了这种错误的作用，作为五个系列实验的一部分。在这项研究中，作者没有发现支持无错误学习条件有益的证据，练习中的错误实际上促进了运动学习过程。


**Qualitative versus Quantitative Information**
**定性与定量信息**

Augmented feedback can be qualitative, quantitative, or both. If the augmented feedback involves a numerical value related to the magnitude of some performance characteristic, it is called **quantitative augmented feedback.** In contrast, **qualitative ­augmented feedback** is information referring to the quality of the performance characteristic ­without ­regard for the numerical values associated with it.
追加反馈信息可以是定性的、定量的或者两者兼用。如果提供与表现特征相关的数字信息，这种追加反馈就属于**定量追加反馈**。与之对应，**定性追加反馈**提供与表现特征质量相关的信息。

For *verbal augmented feedback,* it is easy to distinguish these types of information in perfor­mance situations. For example, a therapist helping a patient to increase gait speed could give that patient qualitative information about the latest attempt in statements such as these: “That was faster than the last time”; “That was much better”; or “You need to bend your knee more.” A physical education teacher teaching a student a tennis serve could tell the student that a particular serve was “good,” or “long,” or could say something like this: “You made contact with the ball too far in front of you.” On the other hand, the therapist could give the patient quantitative verbal augmented feedback using these words: “That time you walked 3 seconds faster than the last time,” or, “You need to bend your knee 5 more degrees.” The teacher could give quantitative feedback to the tennis student like this: “The serve was 6 centimeters too long,” or “You made contact with the ball 10 centimeters too far in front of you.”
提供*语言追加反馈*时，很容易区分这两类信息。例如，康复师帮助患者提高步速，可以向他提供定性的信息，比如：“比上次快多了”、“好多了”、“膝盖需要再弯曲点”等。体育教师教授学生学习网球发球时，可以说某个球“不错”（good）、“过远”（long），或者说“击球点太靠前了”。同时，康复师也可以向患者提供定量的追加反馈信息，如“这次比上次走快了 3 秒”或“膝盖需要再弯曲 5 度”。网球教师亦可向学生提供定量的追加反馈，如“发球远了 6 厘米”或“击球点靠前了 10 厘米”等。

Practitioners also can give quantitative and qualitative information in *nonverbal forms of ­augmented feedback*. For example, the therapist could give qualitative information to the patient we have described by letting him or her hear a tone when the walking speed exceeded that of the previous attempt or when the knee flexion achieved a target amount. The teacher could give the tennis student qualitative information in the form of a computer display that used a moving stick figure to show ­the kinematic characteristics of his or her serving motion. Those teaching motor skills often give ­nonverbally presented quantitative information in combination with qualitative forms. For example, the therapist could show a patient a computer-based graphic representation of his or her leg movement while walking along, displaying numerical values of the walking speeds associated with each attempt or the degree of knee flexion observed on each ­attempt. We could describe similar examples for the tennis student.
从业人员还可以通过*非语言形式的追加反馈*提供定性和定量的信息。例如，康复师可以设置一个蜂鸣器，当患者步速快于或膝关节弯曲角度大于前一次练习时，蜂鸣器就会鸣叫。网球教师通过电脑绘制动态棒图（stick figure）以展示学生发球动作的运动学特征，向学生提供发球动作的定量信息。在运动技能教学中，常将定量信息与定性形式相结合。例如，康复师可以让患者观看行走时腿部运动的电脑图像，同时显示每次练习的步速或膝关节弯曲的角度。同样，我们在上述的网球发球学习中也可以运用类似的方法。

How do these two types of augmented feedback information influence skill learning? Although the traditional view is that quantitative augmented feedback is preferred, results from an experiment by Magill and Wood (1986) suggest a different ­conclusion. Each participant practiced moving his or her arm through a series of wooden barriers to produce a specific six-segment movement pattern. Each segment had its own criterion movement time, which participants had to learn. Performance for the first sixty trials showed no difference between qualitative and quantitative forms of KR. However, during the final sixty trials and on the twenty no-KR retention trials, quantitative KR resulted in better performance than qualitative.
这两种类型的追加反馈对运动技能学习有何影响呢？尽管，传统观点认为定量追加反馈的效果更好，但是来自 Magill 和 Wood （1986）的实验却显示了不同结果。实验中的每位受试者移动手臂通过木制的障碍，执行一个特定的 6 段运动。受试者需要学习按照各段的标准运动时间运动。在随后的每次练习中，受试者获得各部分的定性 KR（即“太快”、“太慢”、“对了”）或者定量 KR（与标准时间相差的时间数）。获得两种类型 KR 被试的前 60 次练习表现间无显著性差异。然而，在后 60 次练习以及 20 次无 KR 的保留测试中，定量 KR 比定性 KR 导致更好的表现。

These results suggest that people in the early stage of learning give attention primarily to the qualitative information, even when they have quantitative information available. The advantage of this attention focus is that the qualitative information provides an easier way to make a first approximation of the required movement. Put another way, this information allows learners to perform an action that is “in the ballpark” of what they need to do, which, as we discussed in chapter 12, is an important goal for the first stage of learning. After they achieve this “ballpark” capability, quantitative information becomes more valuable to them, because it enables them to refine characteristics of performing the skill that lead to more consistent and efficient achievement of the action goal. It is important to keep in mind that there are limits to learners’ abilities to use quantitative feedback to change their movement patterns. Giblin, Farrow, Reid, Ball, and Abernethy (2015) recently showed that skilled junior tennis players could only execute a limited number of feedback-based instructions to improve their service action. The players’ ability to implement more precise instructions was apparently limited by their kinesthetic sensitivity.
这些结果显示，在学习阶段早期，即使得到定量的信息，但个体仍主要注意定性的信息。这种注意焦点的利处在于，一方面，定性信息为最初接近目标要求的尝试提供了比较简单的方式；另一方面，这些信息使个体集中于执行完成任务所必需的动作，这是学习最初阶段的一个重要目标。在他们获得基本技能后，定量信息对他们将更有用，因为这些信息可以使他们完善技能执行，从而更一致、有效地达到动作目标。此外需要记住，学习者使用定量反馈来改变他们的运动模式的能力是有限的。Giblin、Farrow、Reid、Ball 和 Abernethy （2015）的研究表明，较为熟练的青少年网球运动员只能完成有限数量的基于反馈的指令来改善他们的发球动作，因为学习者执行更精确指令的能力显然会受到他们动觉敏感性的限制。

**Augmented Feedback Based on Error Size**
**根据错误程度提供追加反馈**

A question that has distinct practical appeal is this: How large an error should a performer make before the instructor or therapist gives augmented feedback? To many, it seems reasonable to provide ­feedback only when errors are large enough to ­warrant attention. This approach suggests that in many skill learning situations, practitioners develop **perfor­­mance bandwidths** that establish perfor­mance error tolerance limits specifying when they will or will not give augmented feedback. When a person’s perfor­mance is acceptable (i.e., within the tolerance limits of the bandwidth) the practitioner does ­not give feedback. But if the perfor­mance is not ­acceptable (i.e., the amount or type of error is outside the bandwidth) the practitioner gives feedback.
一个与实际运用密切相关的问题是，个体犯多大程度的错误，教师或康复师才会提供追加反馈？对于大多数情况，只有当所犯错误大到必须引起注意时才可以提供反馈。这一方法表明在许多运动技能学习情境中，从业人员形成了所谓的**表现带宽**（performance bandwidths），这一带宽提供了是否提供追加反馈的判断标准。当个体的表现是可以接受的，即处于带宽允许的范围内，从业人员将不提供追加反馈。但是，如果表现是不能接受的，即超出了带宽允许的范围，从业人员就将向个体提供追加反馈。

Research supports the effectiveness of the performance bandwidth approach. For example, in the first reported experiment investigating this procedure, Sherwood (1988) had participants practice a rapid elbow-flexion task with a movement-time goal of 200 msec. One group received KR about their movement-time error after every trial, regardless of the amount of error (i.e., 0 percent ­bandwidth). Two other groups received KR only when their error exceeded bandwidths of 5 percent and 10 percent of the goal movement time. The results of a no-KR retention test showed that the 10 percent bandwidth condition resulted in the least amount of movement time variability (i.e., variable error), whereas the 0 percent condition resulted in the most variable error. Other researchers have replicated and extended these results (e.g., Cauraugh, Chen, & Radlo, 1993; Coca-Ugrinowitsch et al., 2014; Lee, White, & Carnahan, 1990).
研究支持了表现带宽的效用。例如，在首例相关实验研究中，Sherwood （1988）让受试者练习 200 毫秒目标时间的快速曲肘任务。其中一组受试者在每次练习后均获得关于运动时间的 KR，无论其错误的大小（即 0%带宽）。另外两组被试只有当他们的运动时间超出目标时间的 5%或 10%时，获得 KR。无 KR 的保留测试显示，10%带宽条件导致最小的运动时间变化（即可变误差 VE 最小），而 0%带宽条件导致最大的可变误差。其他研究者也重复验证了这些结果（例如，Cauraugh, Chen, & Radlo, 1993; Coca-Ugrinowitsch et al., 2014; Lee, White, & Carnahan, 1990）。

A practical issue concerning the use of the bandwidth technique relates to the instructions provided about the bandwidth procedure. This issue is relevant because when the learners receive no augmented feedback about their performance, the implicit message is that it was “correct.” There is an instruction-related question here: Is it important that the learner explicitly be told this information, or will the learner implicitly learn this information during practice? According to the results of an ­experiment by Butler, Reeve, and Fischman (1996), the bandwidth technique leads to better learning when the participants know in advance that not ­receiving KR means they are essentially “correct.”
与带宽技术相关的另一个实际问题和学习者获得的关于表现带宽的口授有关。这个议题之所以相关是因为当学习者不获得关于表现的追加反馈时，就暗示他们的表现是“正确的”。这里有一个的问题：是否要明确地告知学习者这一点？还是让学习者自己在练习中隐式地体会出来？Butler、Reeve 和Fischman （1996）在研究中探讨了这一问题，他们的实验显示，在使用带宽技术时，如果受试者预先知道无 KR 意味着“基本正确”，学习效果更好。

**Erroneous Augmented Feedback**
**错误的追加反馈**

One of the ways augmented feedback hinders learning is by providing people with erroneous information. While this statement may seem unnecessary because it makes such common sense, the statement gains importance when it is considered in the context of practicing a skill that can be learned *without* augmented feedback. In this skill learning situation, augmented feedback is redundant with the information available from task-intrinsic feedback. As a result, most people would expect that to provide augmented feedback would be a waste of time because it would not influence the learner. But research evidence shows that this is not the case, because even when augmented feedback is redundant information, beginners will use it rather than ignore it.
追加反馈阻碍学习的方式之一就是向个体提供错误的信息。尽管这种叙述可能是没有必要的，因为这是常识，但是个体在*无追加反馈*也能习得技能的情境中，这一问题又有其重要性。在此类技能学习情境中，追加反馈是多余的，因为个体可以通过任务内在反馈获得相应信息。因此，大多数人认为提供追加反馈是浪费时间，它不会对学习者造成影响。但是研究证据显示，事实并非如此，因为即使当追加反馈是多余的信息，初学者仍然会使用这些信息，而不是忽略它。

The first evidence of this type of effect was reported by Buekers, Magill, and Hall (1992). Participants practiced an anticipation timing task similar to the one used by Magill, Chamberlin, and Hall (1991), which was described earlier in this chapter as a task for which KR is not needed to learn the task. In the Buekers et al. experiment, three of four groups received KR after every trial. The KR was displayed on a computer monitor and indicated to the participants 
the direction and amount of their timing error. For one of these groups, KR was ­always correct. But for another group, KR was ­always erroneous by indicating that performance on a trial was 100 msec later than it actually was. The third KR group received correct KR for the first fifty trials, but then received the erroneous KR for the last twenty-five trials. 
A fourth group did not ­receive KR during practice.
Buekers、Magill 和 Hall（1992）报告了首例相关证据。受试者练习与本章前面探讨过的 Magill、Chamberlin 和 Hall（1991）实验相类似的一致性时机任务，此类情境中个体不需要追加反馈就可以习得技能。在这项实验中，4 组中的 3 组被试在每次练习后都获得 KR。KR 显示在电脑屏幕上，代表个体表现错误的方向和数量。3 组受试者中，第一组获得的 KR 是完全正确的。但是对于第二组受试者， KR 提供的信息是错误的，比实际的 KR 值大 100 毫秒。第三组的受试者在前 50 次练习中获得正确的 KR，之后的 25 次练习中获得错误的 KR。这三组之外的第四组在练习中不获得 KR。

The results (figure 15.3) showed two important findings. First, the correct-KR and the no-KR groups did not differ during the practice or the retention trials, which confirmed previous findings that augmented feedback is not needed to learn this skill. Second, the erroneous KR information led ­participants to learn to perform according to the KR rather than according to the task-intrinsic feedback. This latter result suggested that the *par­ticipants used KR, even though it was erroneous ­information*. Even more impressive was that the erroneous KR influenced the group that had received correct KR for fifty trials and then was switched to the erroneous KR. After the switch, this group ­began to perform similarly to the group that had ­received the incorrect KR for all the practice trials. In addition, the erroneous information not only ­influenced performance when it was available but also influenced retention performance one day and one week later when no KR was available. A subsequent experiment (McNevin, Magill, & Buekers, 1994) demonstrated that the erroneous KR also influenced performance on a no-KR transfer test in which participants were required to respond to a faster or slower speed than they practiced.
结果（如图 15.3 所示）显示了两个重要的发现：第一，在练习过程和保留测试中，正确 KR 和无 KR 组的表现无差异；第二，错误 KR 条件使被试根据 KR 信息执行技能，而不是根据任务内在的反馈信息。后一个结果显示，*即使 KR 提供的信息是错误的，执行者仍然使用 KR*。令人印象更深的是，前 50 次练习获得正确 KR，之后获得错误 KR 的组同样受到了错误 KR 的影响。该组变换了练习条件后，表现出与全部获得错误 KR 组相似的水平。此外，KR 提供的错误信息不仅在有 KR 的提供的练习时造成了影响，而且还影响来 1 天后和 1 周后的保留测试。后续研究（McNevin, Magill, & Buekers, 1994）证实错误 KR 同样影响无 KR 提供的迁移测试（该测试的目标反应速度快于或慢于练习时的目标速度）。

The preceding demonstrations of erroneous KR effects were based on laboratory tasks, but similar results have been shown for sports skills. For example, an experiment by Ford, Hodges, and Williams (2007) had skilled soccer players kicking a ball to a target, which required that the ball achieve a ­specific height during its flight. One group of ­players received erroneous KR about the height of the ball’s flight during each kick by observing a prerecorded video clip of a kicked ball that reached a height that was different from their own. Results showed that the players eventually based the height of their kicks on the erroneous video feedback rather than on their own sensory feedback. Erroneous augmented feedback has also been used in clinical settings to treat people with chronic pain conditions that are thought to result from distorted representations of the painful body part. For example, presenting osteoarthritis patients with resized images of their arthritic body part has been shown to change the patients’ distorted perception of the size of the body part and reduce their pain (e.g., Gilpin, Moseley, Stanton, & Newport, 2015; Martini, 2016).
之前关于错误 KR 造成影响的实验都是基于实验室任务，但是在现实的运动技能也有类似的结果。例如，Ford、Hodges 和 Williams （2007）的一项实验让熟练的足球运动员将球踢向目标，并要求球在飞行过程中达到特定的高度。一组球员接受了错误的 KR，具体的方法是这些球员每次在踢完球后，研究人员都会展示一个预先录制的视频片段，让球员以为这是自己刚刚踢出的球，但实际上视频里球的高度和球员实际踢出的高度并不一样。结果显示，球员最终会根据错误的视频反馈而不是自己的感官反馈来决定踢腿的高度。错误的追加反馈也被用于慢性疼痛患者的临床治疗。这些患者的疼痛被认为是对疼痛部位的扭曲感知（distorted representations of the painful body part）造成的。例如，向骨关节炎患者呈现其患关节炎部位的缩放后的图像已被证明可改变患者对身体部位大小的扭曲感知，进而减轻他们的疼痛（例如，Gilpin, Moseley, Stanton, & Newport, 2015; Martini, 2016）。

*Why would erroneous KR affect learning a skill for which KR is redundant information?* The most likely reason appears to be that when people perform skills, they rely on augmented feedback to help them deal with their *uncertainty* about what the task-intrinsic feedback is telling them. For the anticipation timing and soccer kicking tasks referred to earlier, the uncertainty may exist because the visual task-­intrinsic feedback is difficult to consciously observe, interpret, and use. Evidence for an ­uncertainty-based explanation has been demonstrated in experiments by Buekers, Magill, and Sneyers (1994), and Buekers and Magill (1995).
*为什么错误且多余的 KR 还会影响学习呢？* 最有可能的解释是，初学者依赖于追加反馈帮助著他们处理任务内在反馈信息中*不确定*的部分。在先前提到的一致性时机任务和足球实验中都可能存在这种不确定性，因为视觉的任务内在反馈很难有意识地观察、解释和使用。Buekers、Magill 等（1994）和Buekers、Magill （1995）的实验证实了这一解释。

The important message for practitioners here is that people, especially those who are in the early stage of skill learning, will use augmented feedback when it is available, whether it is correct or not. Because of their uncertainty about how to use or interpret ­task-intrinsic feedback, beginners rely on augmented feedback as a critical source of information on which to base how they will make corrections ­on future trials. As a result, instructors need to be certain that they provide correct augmented feedback.
这里对于从业人员比较重要的信息是处于技能学习阶段早期的个体在可以获得 KR 时，会利用 KR 提供的信息，无论其正确与否。由于初学者不确定该如何利用和解释任务内在反馈，他们将追加反馈作为关键的信息源，以便确定即来反应的调整方向。因此，指导者必须保证提供正确的追加反馈。

**TYPES OF KNOWLEDGE OF PERFORMANCE**
**操作反馈的类型**

Most of the research on which we base our knowledge of augmented feedback and skill learn­ing comes from laboratory experiments in which ­researchers gave KR to participants. Although most of the conclusions from that research also apply to KP, it is ­useful to look at some of the research that has investigated different types of KP.
我们获得关于追加反馈和技能学习的知识大多数来自于提供 KR 的实验室研究。尽管此类研究中得出的结论大多数可以适用于 KP，但是，探讨不同类型 KP 的研究文献也是很有帮助的。

**Verbal KP**
**言语 KP**

One reason practitioners give verbal KP more than verbal KR is that KP gives people more information to help them improve the movement characteristics that underlie skilled performance. One of the problems that arises with the use of verbal KP is determining the appropriate content: what to tell the person practicing the skill. This problem occurs because skills are typically complex and KP usually relates to a specific feature of skill performance. The challenge for the instructor or therapist, then, is selecting the appropriate features of the performance on which to base KP.
从业人员更多提供言语 KP（而不是 KR），因为它可以向学习者提供有助于提高技能表现的信息。使用言语 KP 时，会遇到的一个问题是确定恰当的内容，即告诉正在练习技能的个体什么信息。这一问题确实存在，因为运动技能通常都是复杂的，并且 KP 只能提供关于技能执行某方面特征的信息。那么，对于教师或康复师的挑战就是选择恰当的表现特征作为 KP 的内容。

***Selecting the skill component for KP.***
***为 KP 选择技能部分***

The first thing the practitioner must do is perform a *skill analysis* of the skill being practiced. This means identifying the various component parts of the skill. Then, he or she should prioritize each part in ­terms of how critical that part is for performing the skill. Prioritize by listing the most critical part first, then the second most critical, and so on. To determine which part is most critical, decide which part of the skill absolutely must be done properly for the person to achieve the skill’s action goal. For example, for the skill of throwing a dart at a target, the most critical component is looking at the target. This part is the most critical because even if a ­beginner did all other parts of the skill correctly (which would be unlikely), there is a very low chance that he or she would throw the dart accurately without looking at the target. In this case, then, looking at the target would be first on the skill analysis priority list, and would be the first part of the skill assessed in ­determining what to give KP about. (For two examples of research reporting the use and benefit of a skill analysis approach to selecting skill components as the basis for 
verbal KP, see Magill & ­Schoenfelder-Zohdi, 1996 and Weeks & Kordus, 1998.)
为了解决这个问题，教师、教练和康复师必须要做的是第一件事是*分析技能*，即确定技能的各不同部分和方面。然后，应该针对这些部分在正确执行技能中的重要性，区分优先次序。首先是最关键的部分，其次是第二重要的部分，依此类推。为了确定哪个部分是最重要的，需要考虑正确执行技能时，哪一部分必须恰当执行。例如，在相对简单的投飞镖任务中，最关键的部分是注视目标。技能的这一部分是最重要的，因为如果不注视目标，即使执行者准确执行了其他技能环节，也极少有可能正确地执行整个技能。此时，注视目标就是该技能中最重要的部分，并且在提供 KP 时最先应该考虑到这一方面。（关于使用这一方法的研究实例，见 Magill & Schoenfelder-Zohdi, 1996 and Weeks & Kordus, 1998）

***Descriptive and prescriptive KP.***
After determining which aspect of the skill about which to give KP, the practitioner needs to decide the content of the statement to make to the learner. There are *two types of verbal KP statements.* A **descriptive KP** statement simply describes the error the performer has made. The other type, **prescriptive KP,** not only identifies the error, but also tells the person what to do to correct it. For example, if you tell a person, “You moved your right foot too soon,” you describe only the problem. However, if you say, “You need to move your right foot at the same time as you move your right arm,” you also give prescriptive information about what the person needs to do to correct the problem.
***描述性 KP 和说明性 KP***
确定了针对技能的哪一部分提供 KP 后，实践工作者还需要确定向学习者提供的陈述内容。提供言语 KP 有*两种方式*：一种是**描述性 KP** (descriptive KP），仅简单描述执行者所犯的错误；另一种是**说明性 KP** (prescriptive KP），不仅指出错误，而且还要告知执行者如何纠正错误。例如，如果你告诉某人“你过早地移动了右脚”，此时仅描述了出现的问题。但是，如果你说，“在移动右手臂的同时再移动右脚”，就在指出错误的同时提供了纠正错误的方法。

*Which type of verbal KP better facilitates learning?* The answer is that it depends on the stage of learning of the person practicing the skill. For example, the descriptive KP statement, “You moved your right foot too soon,” would help a beginner only if he or she knew the actual time at which the right foot was supposed to move. Thus, descriptive KP statements are useful to help people improve ­performance only after they have learned what they need to do to make a correction. This suggests that *prescriptive KP statements are more helpful for beginners. But, for the more advanced performer, a descriptive KP statement often will suffice.*
*哪一种 KP 更能促进学习呢？* 答案是根据练习者学习的阶段而有所不同。例如，只有当学习者知道移动右脚的恰当时机时，“过早地移动了右脚”的描述性言语才能有利于个体的学习。因此，只有当个体已经习得如何纠正动作时，描述 KP 才有助于个体提高绩效。这提示说明性 KP 更适用于初学者。对于高水平执行者，描述性 KP 就足够了。

**Manual Guidance as Augmented Feedback**
**使用手动指导作为追加反馈**
The type of augmented feedback we call “manual feedback” has been referred to by various terms in the motor learning research literature. Other terms have included “haptic” feedback, “kinesthetic” feedback, and “tactile” feedback. Each suggests a nonverbal presentation of augmented feedback. This type of augmented feedback can take various forms. Some examples include the following: A gymnastics or dance teacher moves a gymnast’s or dancer’s arms through a preferred trajectory after the gymnast or dancer performs a specific skill; a golf instructor moves the hands of a beginning golfer to a desired grip on the club after the golfer grips the club; and a physical therapist moves the legs of a patient as the patient attempts to walk on a slow-moving treadmill. Each of these examples demonstrates the variety of skill learning situations in which motor skill practitioners use manual guidance as augmented feedback. The important question researchers have asked is this: Does the use of manual guidance in situations like these benefit the learning of a motor skill?
本节要讨论一类称为“手动反馈”（manual feedback）的追加反馈。在运动学习研究文献中，还有许多其他术语来指代这一反馈类型，包括“触觉反馈”（haptic feedback，tactile feedback）和“动觉反馈”（kinesthetic feedback）等。无论哪种称呼，都表明这是一种非语言形式的追加反馈。这种类型的增强反馈可以采取各种形式。比如：舞蹈老师在舞蹈演员执行特定技能后，抓着他们的手臂用标准的轨迹移动一遍；高尔夫初学者在握紧球杆后，他们的教练将他们的手移动到球杆上的理想握杆位置；病人试图在缓速跑步机上行走时，物理治疗师移动病人的腿。上述这些例子展示了在各种不同情境下使用手动指导作为追加反馈的方法。研究人员提出的重要问题是：在这些情况下使用手动指导真的有利于学习运动技能吗？

The amount of published research addressing this question is limited, but we will consider some examples here to summarize a general answer. Two studies reported manual guidance augmented feedback having a positive effect on improving gymnastics skills (Jeraj & Heinen, 2015; Rohleder & Vogt, 2018). In both studies, the manual guidance took the form of coaches’ hand placements on the gymnasts as they performed the skills. In an experiment involving nonrowers learning a simulated rowing task, Sigrist, Rauter, Riener, and Wolf (2013) compared manual guidance (which the authors referred to as “haptic” feedback) with several other types of augmented feedback (visual and auditory) presented concurrently and terminally to the participants as they performed the rowing task. The augmented feedback was used to enhance the learning of different aspects of the task, such as a robotic device that pulled the oar blade to the target trajectory when error was detected, and a vibrator on a forearm to indicate blade orientation error. Results showed that the augmented feedback produced the best learning, as assessed by a retention test, when the several types of augmented feedback were used in combination rather than alone. Finally, a study by Zhong and Stone (2013) found that manual guidance produced by a complex machine created specifically for the experiment, produced better welding skills compared to a condition in which participants did not use the training machine. 
针对这个问题发表的研究数量有限，但我们将在这里研究一些例子来总结出一个大致的答案。两项研究报告了手动指导对提高体操技能的表现水平有积极作用（Jeraj & Heinen, 2015; Rohleder & Vogt, 2018）。在这两项研究中，运动员在进行技能训练时教练将手放在他们身上进行手动指导。在一项涉及无划船经验的受试者学习模拟划船的实验中，Sigrist、Rauter、Riener 和 Wolf （2019）比较了手动指导（他们称为“触觉反馈”）和其他几种类型的追加反馈（视觉和听觉），这些反馈会在受试者进行练习时和练习结束后给出。这项任务的许多方面都使用了追加反馈以增强学习效果，例如，当检测到错误时，机械臂会将桨叶拉到目标轨迹，受试者前臂上的振动器也会指示桨叶方向错误。结果表明，当几种类型的追加反馈结合使用而不是单独使用时，产生的学习效果最好（效果通过保留测试评价）。最后，在 Zhong 和 Stone （2013）的一项研究中，他们专为实验设计了一套复杂的训练装置。结果表明，在焊接技能上，使用这套装置提供手动指导的受试者表现得比没有使用这套装置的受试者更好。

The small amount of research literature available on this topic suggests that manual guidance feedback can effectively facilitate the learning of various types of motor skills, including sports and industrial skills. In particular, it appears that when manual guidance is effective as augmented feedback it relates to specific movement features of a skill. These appear to include limb, body, or head positioning, and movement trajectory. Perhaps more important is one of the potential problems the use of manual guidance as augmented feedback can create. Authors in the studies described in the previous paragraph expressed concern that manual guidance as augmented feedback can develop a dependence on the feedback by the learner. As you studied in earlier chapters about theories and stages of learning, the consistent view promoted was that active, movement-problem-solving practice leads to better learning than passive, movement-guided practice. Together with the studies discussed here, the important point to emphasize about the use of manual guidance as augmented feedback is that it can be useful when implemented in a way that encourages learners to actively perform movements and not become dependent on errors being passively corrected. We will discuss later in this chapter concerns about dependency on augmented feedback and some practice strategies that can help overcome its negative influence on learning skills.
关于这一主题的少量研究文献表明，手动指导可以有效地促进各种类型的运动技能的学习，包括运动技能和工业技能。特别是，当手动指导作为追加反馈有效时，它似乎与技能的特定运动特征有关，包括肢体、身体或头部的定位和运动轨迹。不过，更使用手动指导作为增强反馈可能产生的潜在问题同样非常值得注意。上一段所述研究的作者担心，作为增强反馈的手动指导会对学习者的反馈产生依赖。前面关于学习理论和学习阶段的章节一致认为，需要主动解决运动问题的练习相比于比被动的接受运动引导的练习，学习效果会更好。因此，综合考虑这些理论后得到的启示是，只有以鼓励学习者主动执行动作而不是被动依赖外界纠错的方式使用手动指导时，才能发出手动指导的效果。我们将在本章后面讨论对追加反馈的依赖以及一些用于克服这一负面影响的实践策略。

**Video Recordings as Augmented Feedback**
**使用录像作为追加反馈**

The availability and use of video recordings as augmented feedback argues for the need for practitioners to know about how to use them effectively. It is common to find Internet sites and articles in professional journals that offer guidelines and suggestions for the use of video replays as feedback (e.g., Bertram, Marteniuk, & Guadagnoli, 2007; Franks & Maile, 1991; Jambor & Weekes, 1995; ­Trinity & Annesi, 1996). However, very little empirical research exists that establishes the effectiveness of video replays as an aid for skill acquisition. In fact, the most recent extensive review of the research literature related to the use of video recordings as a source of augmented feedback in skill learning situations was published many years ago (Rothstein & Arnold, 1976). One likely reason why more recent reviews have not been published is that the research reported since that review has supported its general conclusions rather than establish different ones.
录像技术的普及使得更多的人将录像作为提供追加反馈的手段，这就要求实践者更详细地了解这种技术手段的效用。通常在一些专业性的期刊上，可以看到关于如何将录像作为反馈的指导和建议（例如，Bertram, Marteniuk, & Guadagnoli, 2007; Franks & Maile, 1991; Jambor & Weekes, 1995; ­Trinity & Annesi, 1996）。然而，却很少有关于“录像”这种技能学习辅助手段效用的实验性研究。事实上，对于运动技能学习情境中，使用录像作为追加反馈的最新、最广泛的研究综述还是在多年前发表的（Rothstein & Arnold, 1976）。一个可能的原因是从这篇综述发表以来的研究都是支持了其结论，而非提出了新的看法。

The most significant conclusion from that review was that the critical factor for determining the effectiveness of video replays as an instructional aid was the *skill level of the learner rather than the type of activity.* For beginners to benefit from video replays, they require the assistance of an instructor to point out critical information. Advanced performers do not appear to need instructor aid as frequently, although discussions with skilled athletes suggest they often receive greater benefit from observing replays when they receive some form of attention-directing instructions, such as verbal cues and checklists.
这篇综述中最重要的一个观点是，决定录像这种技术手段效用的关键因素是个体的技能水平，而不是活动的类型。对于初学者，要想从录像播放中获益，需要指导者指出其中的关键信息。高水平执行者则不需要指导者频繁地帮助，虽然与高水平运动的访谈显示在播放录像时，提供某些形式的注意指向口授（如言语线索和核对列表）可以使运动员获得更多的利处。

A good example of research that demonstrated the benefit of having an instructor point out what the observer of the video replay should look for was ­reported in an experiment that compared video replay as KP to verbal KP and no KP for ­teaching moderately skilled golfers to hit a golf ball for ­distance and accuracy (Guadagnoli, Holcomb, & Davis, 2002). Three groups engaged in 90 min training sessions on each of four days: a control group, which the researchers called the “self-guided” group, practiced without any KP but could hit as many golf balls as they wanted; a verbal KP group received feedback from a PGA teaching professional throughout each session. The video KP group saw video replays of their swings throughout the sessions as well as getting the verbal KP from the teaching professional. The goal was to hit golf balls with a 7-iron as far as possible along a straight line. Performance was assessed by several distance and accuracy measures. Figure 15.4 shows the ­results for the “accuracy distance” measure, which was calculated by subtracting the distance a ball was off the straight target line from the total distance. This result, which is representative of the other measures, indicates the effectiveness of the video replay added to the verbal KP group for learning the golf swing: The video KP group performed better than the other two groups on a retention test given two weeks after the end of the training sessions (i.e., two-week posttest). An interesting characteristic of this study demonstrates the importance of augmented feedback in relation to the amount of practice given to the learner. Because the golfers were not limited to hitting a specified number of balls during each training session, the three groups differed in the number of balls hit during training. Surprisingly, the control group hit the most practice balls, but performed worse than the other two groups. The video KP group hit the fewest practice balls but learned the skill better than the other two groups.
Guadagnoli、Holcomb 和 Davis 的一项实验（2002）将录像带KP、语言 KP 和没有 KP 进行了比较，很好地显示了指导者指出录像中关键信息的重要性。实验内容为训练中等水平的高尔夫球手击球的距离和准确性。所有受试者被分为了三个小组，接连四天每天进行 90 分钟的训练：对照组（研究人员称为“自我指导”组）在没有任何 KP 的情况下练习，但可以打尽可能多的高尔夫球；语言 KP 组在每次练习中都收到来自 PGA 教学专家的反馈；录像带 KP 组每次练习后观看他们挥杆的视频回放，并得到专业教学人员的语言 KP。练习的目标是用7号铁杆沿直线尽可能远地击球，通过几种表征距离和准确度的测量量综合评价表现。图15.4显示了“精确距离”（accuracy distance）测量量，其计算方式为从总距离中减去球偏离目标直线的距离。实验结果证明了语言 KP 外加录像回放对于学习高尔夫挥杆的有效性：在训练期结束后两周进行的保留测试（即两周后的后测）中，录像带 KP 组比其他两组表现得更好。有趣的是，这一研究也凸显了追加反馈相对于练习量的重要性：因为实验不限制每次训练中的击球数量，因此三组在训练中击打的球的数量是不同的；然而，尽管对照组击球次数最多，但表现比其他两组都差；录像带 KP 组的击球次数最少，但却比其他两组的掌握的更好。

Research evidence also establishes that video replays *transmit certain types of performance-related information more effectively than other types.* One of the best examples of an experiment that supports this conclusion was one conducted many years ago by Selder and Del Rolan (1979). They compared videotape replays and verbal augmented feedback (in the form of KP) in a study in which twelve-to-thirteen-year-old girls were learning to perform a balance beam routine. All the girls used a checklist to critically analyze their own perfor­mance after each trial. One group used verbal KP to complete the checklist; another group completed the checklist after viewing videotape replays of each trial. At the end of six weeks of practice, the videotape group scored significantly higher on the routine than the verbal KP group. More important, when each factor of the total routine score was evaluated, the videotape group scored significantly higher on only four of the eight factors: precision, execution, amplitude, and orientation and direction. The two groups did not differ on the other four: rhythm, elegance, coordination, and lightness of jumping and tumbling.
研究证据还证实，录像演示比其他手段更*有效地向学习者传递相关信息*。多年前，Selder 和 Del Rolan （1970）进行的实验就支持了这一观点。他们比较了 12~13 岁女孩在学习平衡木套路时，录像演示与言语 KP 条件之间的差异。在每次练习后每个被试都使用核对表评价自己的执行。言语 KP 组使用言语 KP 完成核对列表；而录像反馈组在观看动作的录像回放后完成核对表。6 周的练习结束时，录像组在套路执行上的得分远高于言语 KP 组。更重要的是，对每一个小项得分进行分析时，录像组在 8 个小项中的精确性、完成、幅度和定位与方向等 4 小项上的得分显著高于言语 KP 组。在其他 4 个小项：节奏、优美性、协调性、跳跃和翻腾的轻盈度等方面录像组和言语 KP 组无明显差异。

The results of this study suggest that video replay facilitates the learning of those performance features that performers can readily observe and determine how to correct on the basis of what they see on the video replay. However, for performance features that are difficult to visually discern, video replay is no more effective than verbal KP.
这些结果提示，对于那些能够根据录像演示来观察和纠正的执行特征，录像演示手段可以促进其掌握。然而，对于那些不容易辨别的执行特征，录像演示手段并不比言语 KP 更有效。

**Movement Kinetics and Kinematics as Augmented Feedback**
**将动作的运动学特征作为追加反馈**

With the widespread availability of sophisticated technology for measuring, recording, and displaying human movement, the presentation of kinematic and kinetic information as augmented feedback has become increasingly common. Magill and Anderson (2012) have highlighted a range of different ways in which feedback on kinematic and kinetic parameters has been used to facilitate the learning of sports skills. However, the use of such feedback has been equally prevalent in clinical settings; primarily during rehabilitation from accident or injury, but increasingly as a means to prevent injuries that result from poor technique (e.g., Benjaminse et al., 2015; Crowell, Milner, Hamill, & Davis, 2010). Though we have much to learn about the kinematic and kinetic parameters on which to provide feedback and the most effective ways to present this information, recent research has shown that this type of augmented feedback can allow learners to quickly acquire patterns of coordination that were once considered very difficult, if not impossible, to learn (e.g., Kovacs, Buchanan, & Shea, 2010).
随着计算机软件技术的发展，以运动学分析形式提供的追加反馈已经广泛地运用到运动技能教学和康复情境中。Magill 和 Anderson （2012）强调了一系列使用运动学和动力学参数的反馈来促进运动技能学习的方法。这种反馈在临床环境同样得到了普遍的使用，主要用于伤病康复，但是现在也越来越多地用于预防因技术不佳造成伤害（例如，Benjaminse et al., 2015; Crowell, Milner, Hamill, & Davis, 2010）。尽管我们在如何提供运动学和动力学参数反馈以及如何最有效地呈现这些信息等方面还有很多需要研究，但最近的研究表明，这种类型的增强反馈可以让学习者快速习得曾经被认为极度困难的协调模式（例如，Kovacs, Buchanan, & Shea, 2010）。

One of the first studies to investigate the use of movement kinematics did not involve a computer and was carried out many years ago. This study is important because it illustrates the historical interest in this type of feedback, it involved a real-world training situation, and it exemplifies the positive ­effect that kinematic information can have on skill learning. Lindahl (1945) investigated the methods used to train industrial machine operator trainees to precisely and quickly cut thin disks of tungsten with a machine that required fast, accurate, and rhythmic coordi­nation of the hands and feet. The traditional approach to training for this job was a trial-and-­error method. To assess an alternative method, ­Lindahl created a mechanism that would make a paper tracing of the machine operator’s foot movement pattern during the cutting of each disk. During training, the trainers showed the trainees charts illustrating the correct foot action (see the top portion of figure 15.5), and periodically showed them tracings of their own foot action. The results (see the bottom portion of figure 15.5) indi­cated that this training method based on movement ­kinematic information as augmented feedback enabled the trainees to achieve production perfor­mance levels in eleven weeks, compared to the five months required ­by trainees who used the traditional trial-and-­error method. In addition, the trainees reduced their ­percentage of broken cutting wheels to almost zero in twelve weeks, a level not achieved by those trained with the traditional method in less than nine months.
探讨动作运动学分析的首例研究是多年前进行的，并没有使用计算机。但这一研究却具有重大的意义，因为它显示了长期以来人们对这种反馈形式的研究兴趣，它是在真实的训练情境中进行的，例证了运动学信息对技能学习的积极作用。Lindahl （1945）探讨了一种训练方法的效用，这种方法用于训练机械操作工人用机器切割钨片，执行这项任务需要手和脚快、准确并且是有节奏地协调工作。对于这一任务进行训练的传统方法是反复试错法。为了评估这种新方法的效用，Lindahl 制造了一种仪器，可以在纸上记录出机器执行者切钨片时脚的运动形式。在训练中，让受训者观看脚正确运动的图形（见图 15.5 的上图），并且定期观看自己脚的运动记录图形。结果显示（见图 15.5 下图），这种将运动学分析作为追加反馈的训练方法使受训者在 11 周后就达到了可以正式进行生产的执行水平，与此相对应的是，使用反复试错传统训练方法的受训者在 5 个月后才达到了这一水平。此外，使用新训练方法的受训者在 12 周后打碎切割轮的百分比为零，而使用传统方法的受训者在至少 9 个月的训练后仍不能达到这一水平。

A comprehensive series of experiments reported by Swinnen and his colleagues serve as good examples of more recent laboratory research (Beets et al., 
2012; Swinnen et al., 1990; Swinnen, Walter, Lee, & Serrien, 1993). Participants in these ­experiments practiced a bimanual coordination task that required them to ­simultaneously move two levers, but with each lever requiring a different spatial-temporal movement pattern. Kinematic information was presented as augmented feedback in the form of the angular displacement for each arm superimposed over the criterion displacements. In several experiments, the kinematic augmented feedback was compared with various other forms of augmented feedback. The results consistently demonstrated the effectiveness of the use of the displacement information. Kovacs and colleagues (e.g., Kovacs et al., 2010) have shown that these types of tasks can be learned very quickly if the augmented feedback is superimposed over a template of the to-be-learned pattern and the learner is prevented from seeing his or her arms.
Swinnen 及其同事报告了一系列更为全面的研究，是探讨将运动学分析作为追加反馈形式的实验室研究范例（Beets et al.,2012; Swinnen et al., 1990; Swinnen, Walter, Lee, & Serrien, 1993)。这些实验中的受试者练习同时移动两个操纵杆的双手协调任务，但是每个操纵杆要求不同的空间时间移动形式。运动学信息作为追加反馈，提供的是两手角位移叠加超出标准位移的角位移特征。在数个研究中，比较了运动学追加反馈与其他形式追加反馈条件间的差异。结果一致地证实了使用位移信息的有效性。Kovacs 及其同事（2010）已经表明，如果使用待学习的运动模式的模板提供追加反馈，并且防止学习者看到他们的手臂，则可以非常快速地学习这些类型的任务。

An experiment by Wood, Gallagher, Martino, and Ross (1992) provides a good example of the use of graphically displayed movement kinematics for learning a sports skill. Participants practiced hitting a golf shot with a 5-iron. A commercially marketed golf computer monitored the velocity, displacement, and trajectory path of each swing as the head of the club passed over light sensors on the platform from which the ball was hit. This information was then displayed on a monitor. One group saw a template of an optimum pattern along with the kinematics; a second group did not see this template. A third group received the same kinematic information verbally in the form of numbers. A fourth group received no augmented feedback. On a retention test given one week later without augmented feedback, the group that had observed the graphic presentation of the swing kinematics along with the optimum pattern template performed best.
Wood、Gallagher、Martino 和 Ross（1992）提供了一个很好的研究范例，他们让受试者使用动作的运动学图形学习用 5 号球杆击高尔夫球的任务。实验实验一台市场上广泛使用的商用高尔夫计算机，监视每次挥杆球杆头部经过击球平台上的感光点时挥杆的速度、位移和移动轨迹。之后这些信息在监视器上呈现。其中的一组被试观看最佳动作运动学特征的模板；第二组不观看这一模板；第三组被试以数字形式获得相同内容的言语运动学信息；第四组不获得追加反馈。在一周后的无追加反馈保留测试中，观看最佳动作运动学特征模板组的被试绩效最好。

Another type of kinematic-related information that has been effectively used as augmented feedback is a person’s *center of mass (COM) or center of pressure (COP).* This biomechanical type of information is most commonly used as a type of augmented feedback for people learning or improving static and dynamic balance skills. For example, a study by Taube, Leukel, and Gollhofer (2008) investigated the use of a handheld laser pointed at a target on a wall to provide augmented visual feedback of each participant’s COM to assist them in maintaining upright standing balance on both rigid and unstable surfaces. Results showed that participants maintained better balance stability when they used the laser pointer device than when they did not.
另一类已经被有效地用作追加反馈的运动学相关信息是人的*质心(COM，center of mass)或压力中心(COP，center of pressure)*。这种生物力学类型的信息最常用作人们学习或提高静态和动态平衡技能的一种追加反馈。例如，在 Taube、Leukel 和 Gollhofer（2008）的一项研究中，使用指向墙上特定目标的激光笔，以将每个受试者的 COM 作为视觉追加反馈提供，进而帮助他们在坚硬且不稳定的表面上保持直立平衡。结果显示，受试者在使用激光笔时的表现比没有使用激光笔时更好。

A unique type of kinetic feedback was used by ­Chollet, Micallef, and Rabischong (1988) for swim­mers. The researchers developed swimming paddles that would provide information to enable highly skilled swimmers to maintain their optimal velocity and number of arm cycles in a training ­session. The swim­ming paddles contained force sensors and sound generators that transmitted an audible signal to transmitters in a swimmer’s cap. The sensors were set at a desired water-propulsion-force threshold; when the swimmer reached this threshold, the paddles produced a sound audible to the swimmer. The results showed that this device helped swimmers maintain their stroke count and swimming speed when they otherwise would have found it decreasing through the course of a long-distance practice session.
Chollet、Micallef 和 Rabischong （1988）在游泳运动中使用了一种独特的运动学反馈。研究人员开发了一种可以提供信息游泳桨，旨在让高度熟练的游泳运动员在训练中保持最佳速度和手臂周期数。这种游泳桨包含力传感器和声音发生器，后者的用途是将声音信号传输到泳帽中的发射器。传感器设置了期望的水推进力阈值，当游泳运动员达到这个阈值时，桨就会发出声音让运动员听到。结果表明，这种设备有助于游泳运动员保持他们的划水次数和游泳速度，否则他们的划水次数和游泳速度会在长距离练习过程中会下降。

**Biofeedback as Augmented Feedback**
**使用生物反馈作为追加反馈**

The term **biofeedback** refers to an augmented form of task-intrinsic feedback related to the activity of physiological processes, such as heart rate, blood pressure, muscle activity, and the like. Several forms of biofeedback have been used in motor skill learning situations. The most common is *electromyographic (EMG) biofeedback,* which provides information about muscle activity.
**生物反馈**这一术语是指一种与生理过程（如心率、血压、肌肉活动）等相关的任务内在反馈的追加形式。已经有多种生物反馈运用于运动技能学习情境中。最常用的是肌电生物反馈*（EMG biofeedback），提供关于肌肉活动的电信息。

EMG biofeedback has been commonly used in physical rehabilitation settings and research. Although researchers continue to debate its effectiveness there is general agreement that it can benefit motor skill learning. (For a review and critical analysis of the use of EMG biofeedback in physical therapy see Huang, Wolf, & He, 2006.) The following two research examples illustrate some of the positive results researchers have reported for the use of EMG as a source of augmented feedback. An experiment by Brucker and Bulaeva (1996) used EMG biofeedback with long-term cervical spinal cord–injured people to determine if it would help them increase their voluntary EMG responses from the triceps during elbow extension. Results indicated that participants who experienced only one 45 min treatment session significantly increased their triceps EMG ­activity; and those who experienced additional treatment sessions demonstrated even further increases.
EMG 生物反馈已被广泛用于物理康复和研究。虽然研究人员在其有效性上仍有分歧，但普遍认为这项技术可以有益于运动技能的学习（关于 EMG 生物反馈在物理治疗中的应用的综述和批判性分析，参见 Huang, Wolf, & He, 2006）。以下两个研究实例展示了研究人员使用 EMG 作为追加反馈源取得积极结果。Brucker 和 Bulaeva（1996）对颈脊髓损伤的个体使用肌电生物反馈，以探讨这种手段是否能够有助于个体增加肘伸任务中三头肌的随意肌电反应。治疗后测试结果显示仅接受 45 分钟 EMG 生物反馈治疗的患者，其三头肌 EMG 活动显著增加；又接受额外治疗的患者仍显示出 EMG 活动的继续增加。

The purpose of a study by Intiso and colleagues (1994) was to determine the effectiveness of EMG biofeedback to help poststroke patients overcome foot drop of the paretic limb during the swing phase of walking. Some patients received EMG biofeedback during their physical therapy, whereas others did not. A unique characteristic of this study was the use of gait analysis to assess foot drop during the gait cycle. Results of this analysis demonstrated that the EMG biofeedback intervention led to better recovery than physical therapy without the biofeedback.
Intiso 及其同事（1994）探讨了 EMG 生物反馈对中风患者克服走路摆动阶段麻痹脚下降的效用。一些患者在物理治疗阶段获得 EMG 生物反馈，而另一些患者没有获得这种反馈。这一研究的独特之处是在步态周期中使用步态分析来评价脚的下降。分析结果证实与没有使用 EMG 生物反馈物理治疗相比，EMG 生物反馈干预导致了较好的痊愈。

Finally, another type of biofeedback has been applied in the training of competitive rifle shooters (Daniels & Landers, 1981). Heartbeat biofeedback was presented audibly to help these athletes learn to squeeze the rifle trigger between heartbeats, which is a characteristic of elite shooters.
最后，运动技能学习情境中，一种独特的生物反馈技术已经运用于竞技步枪手的训练中（Daniels & Landers, 1981）。以听觉形式呈现心跳生物反馈（heartbeat biofeedback），帮助运动员学习在两次心跳之间扣动扳机，这是优秀选手的突出特点。

In general, research evidence has supported the effectiveness of biofeedback as a means of facilitating motor skill learning. However, debate continues concerning the specific situations in which the use of biofeedback is an effective and preferred form of augmented feedback, especially in physical rehabilitation situations (e.g., Moreland & Thomson, 1994; Moreland, Thomson, & Fuoco, 1998).
总之，研究证据支持了生物反馈是一种促进运动技能学习的有效方法。然而，关于在哪些情境中生物反馈才是首选的有效形式还存在着争论（例如，Moreland & Thomson, 1994; Moreland, Thomson, & Fuoco, 1998)。

An additional concern about the use of biofeedback as augmented feedback is the tendency for people to become dependent on it to help them perform the skill. The result of this dependency is that when they must perform the skill without biofeedback, their performance level decreases. This concern is not unique to the use of biofeedback but to all types of augmented feedback. We will address this issue, along with strategies to overcome the problem, in the last section of this chapter in which the frequency of presenting augmented feedback will be discussed.
关于使用生物反馈作为追加反馈的一个问题是人们倾向于对其产生依赖。这种依赖的结果是，当在没有生物反馈的情况下执行技能时，他们的表现水平会下降。这种担心并不仅限于生物反馈，而是所有类型的增强反馈都可能造成依赖问题。本章的最后一节将探讨增强反馈的频率，我们将那一节讨论这个问题以及探讨解决该问题的策略。

**TIMING ISSUES RELATED TO AUGMENTED FEEDBACK**
**与追加反馈有关的时机问题**

Finally, three important questions arise about the timing of giving augmented feedback. To continue with the example in which you are teaching a person to play golf, one question is this: Should you give augmented feedback while the person swings, after he or she has hit the ball, or both times? If you give feedback after the person hits the ball, the second question arises: How soon after the person’s hitting of the ball should you give augmented feedback? The third question concerns whether you should give augmented feedback every time the person hits the ball, or only a few times during the practice session.
最后是关于追加反馈提供时机的三个问题。还是我们前面提到的教授高尔夫技能的例子，第一个问题：你应该在学生挥臂时、击球时或者还是在两个时间都提供追加反馈？第二个问题是如果在个体击球后提供追加反馈，应在击球后多久提供？第三个问题：是在个体每次击球后提供追加反馈还是多次击球后提供追加反馈？

**Concurrent and Terminal Augmented Feedback**
**同步追加反馈与末端追加反馈**

Is it better to give augmented feedback while a person is performing a skill, in what is known as **concurrent augmented feedback** or at the end of a practice attempt, in what we call **terminal ­aug­mented ­feedback?** Unfortunately, a search through the motor learning research literature suggests that there is no unequivocal answer to this question. However, a guideline emerges from that literature that can help us answer the question. Terminal augmented feedback can be effective in almost any skill learning situation, although the teacher or therapist must consider the nature of its effect in light of our discussion earlier in this chapter of the four different effects augmented feedback can have on skill learning. Concurrent augmented feedback, as you will see in the following sections of this discussion, seems to be most effective when the task-intrinsic feedback is difficult to use to determine how to perform the skill or improve performance. Because most of the discussion thus far in this chapter has involved terminal augmented feedback, the focus of this section will be on concurrent augmented feedback.
我们所要探讨的第一个时机问题是，在个体执行技能时提供追加反馈，即**同步追加反馈**（concurrent augmented feedback），还是在个体练习后提供追加反馈，即**末端追加反馈**（terminal augmented feedback)? 哪种反馈更能促进技能的习得？遗憾的是，运动技能学习领域的研究文献对这个问题均没有做出明确回答。然而，这些研究文献指出的方针或原则却可以帮助我们回答这个问题。尽管教师或康复师必须根据具体情况确定当前它起何种作用（我们前面讨论过末端追加反馈可以产生 4 种作用），末端追加反馈在大多数运动技能学习情境中都是有效的。正如你将看到的，似乎只有在任务内在反馈很难用于执行和提高技能时，同步追加反馈才最有效。本章的大部分内容都探讨末端追加反馈的相关问题，因此，本节的焦点将是同步追加反馈。

***Effects of concurrent augmented feedback on learning.***
***同步追加反馈对学习的影响***
Research has shown two types of effects for the use of concurrent augmented feedback in skill learning situations. The more common is *a negative learning effect.* Although perfor­mance improves very well during practice when the feedback is available, it declines on retention or transfer trials during which the augmented feedback is removed. In these situations, the concurrent augmented feedback influences learners to direct their attention away from the critical task-intrinsic feedback and toward the augmented feedback. The result is that they substitute the information derived from augmented feedback for the important information they need to acquire from task-intrinsic feedback. Consequently, the augmented feedback becomes an integral part of what is learned, and therefore necessary for future performance which means when it is not available, performance is worse than when it is available.
研究证据显示，在运动技能学习情境中，运用同步追加反馈可能产生两种效果。最普遍的一种结果是*不利于学习的负面效果*。尽管在练习中提供追加反馈时，绩效发生显著提高，但是在不提供追加反馈的保持或迁移测试中，这种绩效会出现下降。此时，同步追加反馈使学习者的注意偏离了关键的任务内在反馈信息，而将注意集中于追加反馈。结果是他们将从同步追加反馈中获得的信息替代了本应该从任务内在反馈中获得的重要信息。这样，同步追加反馈变成了所学任务的一部分，成为今后执行所必需的信息，如果缺失这部分信息，表现将会变糟糕。

Two experiments provide examples of research that has demonstrated this negative learning effect. In the study by Sigrist et al. (2013) discussed earlier in this chapter, the experimenters compared concurrent augmented feedback with several types of augmented feedback presented terminally to nonrowers learning a simulated rowing task, which was very similar to body-arm rowing taught to beginners in their first rowing lessons and used by experienced rowers as a warm-up exercise. Concurrent augmented feedback was presented auditorily and visually as error information about the oar blade’s deviation from the desired movement. This feedback was provided on each trial while the performer was rowing. Similar information was provided terminally at the end of each practice trial for three training sessions with one session on each of three days. A retention test, with no augmented feedback, was given on days four and eleven. Results showed that while the concurrent feedback produced the best performance during the training sessions, the terminal feedback produced the best performance on the retention test.
两个实验提供了证明这种负面学习效应的研究实例。在本章早些时候讨论的 Sigrist 等人（2013）的研究中，实验人员比较了同步增强反馈和几种类型的末端增强反馈。实验让先前没有划船经验的受试者学习模拟划船任务，该动作与初学者在第一次划船课上学到的身体手臂划船非常相似，并也被有经验的划船者用作热身练习。关于桨片偏离期望运动的误差信息的同步增强反馈以听觉和视觉的形式给出。受试者每次尝试时都会接受这种反馈。类似的末端反馈信息会在每次尝试结束时提供。受试者在三天内完成了三次练习课，每天一次。在第四天和第十一天进行了一次没有追加反馈的保留测试。结果显示，同步反馈在培训过程中表现最好，而末端反馈在保留测试中表现最好。

The negative learning effect has also been demonstrated for the learning of a discrete task. Vander Linden, Cauraugh, and Greene (1993) compared concurrent and terminal augmented feedback for learning a 5 sec isometric elbow-extension force production task, which is illustrated in figure 15.6. Participants received augmented feedback by seeing the force produced during the performance of the task on each trial. One group received this feedback concurrently. Two other groups received this feedback after they completed performing the task. One of these two groups saw this information after every trial; the other saw it after every other trial. During the practice trials, the concurrent augmented feedback group performed the task better than the two terminal groups. However, 48 hr later on a retention test with no augmented feedback, the concurrent group’s performance declined to a level that was the poorest of the three groups.
在离散任务的学习中同样有研究显示了这种负面的学习效应。Vander Linden、Cauraugh 和 Greene（1993）比较了同步和末端追加反馈在 5 秒等长肘伸力量产生任务（如图 15.6 所示）中的作用。被试在每次练习中，通过看到执行任务时产生的力获得追加反馈。其中一组在执行的同时获得追加反馈；其他两组在完成执行后获得追加反馈。后两组中的一组在每次练习后获得追加反馈，另外一组则在固定次数的练习后获得追加反馈。在练习期间，同步追加反馈组受试者表现好于其他两个末端追加反馈组。然而，48 小时后的无追加反馈保持测试中，同步追加反馈组表现下降，成为最差的组。

The second general effect is that concurrent augmented feedback *enhances skill learning.* A variety of situations have produced this effect. Some of these are the training of flight skills for airplane ­pilots (e.g., Lintern, 1991), the rehabilitation of motor skills in physical therapy (e.g., Intiso et al., 1994), the activation of specific muscles or muscle groups (e.g., Brucker & Bulaeva, 1996), and the learning of certain types of bimanual coordination laboratory tasks (e.g., Swinnen et al., 1993). In these experiments, concurrent augmented feedback enhanced relevant features of the task-intrinsic feedback that were difficult to discern without the enhancement. Because most of these experiments are described elsewhere in this book, we will not describe them here.
同步追加反馈产生的第二种作用是促进运动技能的学习。很多研究都发现了这种积极的效果。例如，飞行员飞行技能的训练（如 Lintern, 1991）、物理治疗中运动技能的康复（如 Intiso et al., 1994）、特定肌肉或肌群的激活（如 Brucker & Bulaeva, 1996）以及双手协调实验室任务的学习（如 Swinnen et al., 1993）。在这些实验中，同步追加反馈强化了难以辨别的任务内在反馈的相关特征。因为本书的其他部分都详细介绍了这些实验，这里就不在赘述。

***Predicting learning effects of concurrent augmented feedback.***
***预测同步追加反馈的学习效果***
Two related hypotheses have been proposed to help us better understand how to predict when concurrent augmented feedback will have a positive or negative effect on learning. First, Annett (1959, 1969, 1970) stated that augmented feedback should be considered in terms of its ­information value, which he related to the “informa­tiveness” of the task-intrinsic feedback and the augmented feedback. When the information value of task-intrinsic feedback is low, but the information value of the augmented feedback is high, a dependency on the augmented feedback is likely to develop.
有两个相关的假说可以帮助我们预测同步追加反馈在运动技能学习的作用。首先，Annett （1959, 1969, 1970）指出，应该根据追加反馈的信息价值来考虑其作用，即任务内在反馈和追加反馈的信息性。当任务内在反馈的信息价值较低，而追加反馈的信息价值较高时，同步追加反馈将更可能导致个体对追加反馈的依赖。

Lintern and his colleagues (Lintern, 1991; ­Lintern, Roscoe, & Sivier, 1990) added another dimension to Annett’s hypothesis by proposing that practicing with augmented feedback will benefit learning to the extent that the feedback sensitizes the learner to properties or relationships in the ­task that specify how the system being learned can be ­controlled. This means that *for concurrent ­augmented feedback to be effective, it must facilitate the learning of the critical characteristics or relationships in the task as specified by the task-intrinsic feedback.* Negative learning effects will ­result when the augmented feedback distracts attention away from these features. But positive learning effects will result when the augmented feedback ­directs ­attention to these features.
Lintern 及其同事（Lintern, 1991; ­Lintern, Roscoe, & Sivier, 1990）对 Annett 的假说进行了补充，指出提供追加反馈的练习使学习者对任务内的各成分或关系更加敏感，而这些成分或关系详细说明了学习系统应该如何去控制。这就是说*同步追加反馈要起到积极的作用，必须促进任务内在反馈特指的任务关键特征或关系的学习*。如果追加反馈使个体的注意偏离了这些重要特征，必将导致不利的学习效果。但是，如果追加反馈帮助个体将注意指向这些重要特征，将导致积极的学习效果。

An experiment by Buchanan and Wang (2012) shows that very subtle variations in the way that concurrent augmented feedback is provided can dramatically reduce the likelihood that learners will become dependent on the feedback. Participants were required to learn a complex pattern of coordination between the two hands with the aid of a visual display that provided a Lissajous template of the required pattern and a cursor representing the relative position of the two hands. One group (Behind) practiced the task with the cursor superimposed on the template and the other group (Side) practiced the task with the cursor presented in a separate window adjacent to the template. In two experiments, both groups acquired the new pattern of coordination quickly during a 5 min practice session. However, on a retention test given 15 minutes later, the Behind group showed a dramatic drop in performance when the visual feedback was removed, whereas the Side group was able to maintain their level of performance in the absence of augmented feedback. These results show that the strong guidance-like properties of concurrent visual feedback can be exploited to facilitate performance and learning if the feedback is displayed in the appropriate manner.
Buchanan 和 Wang （2012）的一项实验表明，稍稍改变提供同步追加反馈的方式就可以显著降低学习者依赖反馈的可能性。受试者需要学习一种双手复杂协调模式。研究人员准备了一台显示器以帮助受试者学习，该显示器显示了待学习模式的李沙育模板和代表两只手相对位置的光标。一组（后面组）练习时将光标叠加在模板，另一组（侧面组）练习时将光标放在一个单独的窗口中，该窗口位于模板旁。在两个实验中，两组都在5分钟的练习中都很快习得了新的协调模式。然而，在15分钟后进行的保留测试中，当视觉反馈被移除时，后面组的表现出现了极大的下降，而侧面组在没有追加反馈的情况下仍能够保持他们的表现水平。这些结果表明，只要呈现方式得当，同步视觉反馈可以促进技能执行和学习。

**THE KR-DELAY AND POST-KR INTERVALS FOR TERMINAL AUGMENTED FEEDBACK** 
**KR 延迟与 KR 后间隔**

The second timing issue related to augmented feedback concerns when the feedback is given terminally. Two intervals of time are created between two trials: the **KR-delay interval** and the **post-KR ­interval.**1 These intervals are depicted graphically in figure 15.7. To understand the relationship between these intervals and skill learning, we must understand the influence of two variables: *time,* or the length of the interval, and *activity,* or the cognitive and/or motor activity during the interval.
与追加反馈相关的第二个时机问题是应该在何时提供末端追加反馈？两次练习之间的间隔被划分为两个间隔：**KR 延迟间隔**（KR- delay interval）与 **KR 后间隔**（post- KR interval）。这些间隔如图 15.7 所示。为了理解这些间隔与运动技能学习之间的关系，我们必须明白两个变量的影响：*时机*（即这些间隔的长度）以及*活动*（即在这些间隔期间从事的认知或运动活动）。

**The Length of the KR-Delay Interval**
**KR 延迟间隔的长度**

It is not uncommon to see statements in textbooks indicating that a learner should receive augmented feedback as soon as possible after performing a skill, because delaying it beyond a certain amount of time would lead to poorer learning. A significant problem with this viewpoint is that it has little ­research evidence to support it. Such a view comes from research based predominantly on animal learn­ing (see Adams, 1987). Research has established that humans use augmented feedback as more than a reward: augmented feedback has informational value that humans use to solve problems associated with learning a skill. Whereas animal learning studies have shown that delaying reward leads to decreased learning, human skill learning studies have shown that delaying augmented feedback does not have this negative effect.
在教科书中经常看到关于练习后应该尽快提供追加反馈的陈述，因为延迟 KR 过久会导致较差的学习。这一观点缺乏实验研究证据的支持。该观点主要以动物学习的研究为基础（见 Adams, 1987）。研究证实，人类学习中追加反馈的作用决不仅是动物学习情境中的奖励（rewards）：追加反馈具有信息价值，个体可以利用这些信息解决学习过程中遇到的问题。虽然动物学习研究显示延迟奖励将导致学习的减少，但是人类运动技能学习研究显示延迟追加反馈并没有出现这种负面效果。

**Activity during the KR-Delay Interval**
**KR 延迟间隔期间从事的活动**

Researchers investigating the effects of activity during the KR-delay interval have found *three types of outcomes.* The most common effect of activity during the KR-delay interval on skill learning is that it has *no influence on learning.* Experiments have demonstrated this result since the 1960s (e.g., Bilodeau, 1969; Boulter, 1964; Marteniuk, 1986).
探讨 KR 延迟间隔插人活动的研究者发现了*三种可能的结果*。最多见的结果是，KR 延迟间隔中插入活动*对运动技能的学习无影响*。支持这一结果的研究从 20 世纪 60 年代就出现了（例如，Bilodeau, 1969; Boulter, 1964; Marteniuk, 1986）。

The second type of effect is much less common. There is some evidence, although it is sparse, that activity during the KR-delay interval *hinders learning.* Two specific types of activities have shown this negative effect. One type includes activities that ­involve the same learning processes required by the primary task being learned. For example, Marteniuk (1986) showed that when another motor or cognitive skill had to be learned during the KR-delay ­interval, these activities interfered with learning of the primary skill. The other type of activity that ­research has shown to hinder skill learning involved estimating the movement-time error of another person’s movement, which the second person performed during the interval. In an experiment by Swinnen (1990), people learned to move a lever a specified distance, involving two reversals of direction, in a criterion movement time. Participants who engaged in the error estimation ­activity during the KR-delay interval showed worse ­performance on a retention test than those who did nothing or who performed a nonlearning task during the interval.
第二种结果并不多见。尽管很稀少，但是有证据显示，KR 延迟间隔中插入活动*不利于运动技能的学习*。有两类活动的相关研究显示出了这种负面效果。Marteniuk（1986）的研究验证假说：如果 KR 延迟间隔插入活动干扰学习，那么执行这种活动所要求的学习过程干扰了主任务的相同过程。两个实验的结果显示，当被试在 KR 延迟间隔中学习运动或认知任务时，这些活动干扰了主任务的学习。研究显示不利于运动技能学习的另一类插入活动是估计他人的运动时间差，这通常是第二名被试在 KR 延迟间隔中从事的活动。Swinnen（1990） 的实验中，个体学习在规定的目标时间内将执行杆移动一定的距离，这一任务包括两个转向。与在 KR 延迟间隔中不从事任何活动或执行非学习任务的被试相比，在 KR 延迟间隔中进行错误估计活动的被试在保持测试中表现出较差的水平。

***Subjective performance evaluation.***
***主观表现评价***
The third type of effect is that certain activities during the ­KR-delay interval actually can *benefit learning.* One type of activity that has consistently demonstrated this effect requires the person to ­evaluate his or her own performance. We will refer to this activity as the *subjective performance evaluation strategy.* Research has established the effectiveness of two approaches to the use of this strategy. One requires the estimation of the outcome of the performance, the other requires the ­estimation of the movement-related characteristics of the perfor­mance of the skill. Swinnen (1990), in the ­experiment described above, compared the strategies of the participant estimating his or her own ­performance outcome error with estimating perfor­mance outcome error of another person’s movement. Figure 15.8 shows that subjective per­for­­­­­­­­mance ­estimation led to a learning benefit, but estimating another person’s performance hindered learning. More recently, Sherwood (2008) further established the learning benefit of the subjective performance error strategy in an experiment involving four different laboratory learning tasks, in which participants estimated their own error on each trial prior to receiving KR. 
第三种结果是 KR 延迟间隔中插入活动有利于运动技能的学习。研究一致证实，在 KR 延迟间隔中要求个体估计自己的执行错误将有利于技能学习。我们将这种活动称为主观表现评价策略（subjective performance evaluation strategy）。研究已经证实了这一策略的两种使用方法的效果。一种要求估计执行的结果，另一种要求估计技能执行中的相关运动特征。Swinnen（1990）在上面描述的实验中，比较了估计自己执行错误与估计他人执行错误策略之间的差异。图 15.8 显示主观表现评价策略导致较好的学习效果，但是，评价他人执行错误的策略不利于学习。

The second type of beneficial subjective performance estimation involves the estimation of specific characteristics of some of the movement-related components of an action. In an experiment by Liu and Wrisberg (1997) participants practiced throwing a ball at a target as accurately as possible with the nonpreferred arm and without vision of the ­target. Participants received KR by seeing where on the target the ball had landed on each trial. During the KR-delay interval, some of the participants rated on 5-point scales the appropriateness of the force, angle of ball release, and ball trajectory of the throw, and then estimated the throw’s point value on the target. The results indicated that these participants performed more accurately on a retention test than those who had not used the estimation strategy.
主观评价策略的第二种使用方法是估计动作的相关运动特征。Liu 和 Wrisberg（1997）的实验中，被试用非利手在看不到目标的条件下，练习向目标准确掷球任务。每次练习后被试获得 KR，即球在目标上的落点位置。在 KR 延迟间隔中，一些被试在 5 级评分量表上评价用力的恰当性、出手角度、球飞行轨迹，并估计球落点的值。结果显示，与没有采用评价策略的受试者相比，使用这一策略的被试在保持测试中的执行更准确。

We find an interesting parallel to the subjective performance evaluation strategy in what researchers call the *trials-delay procedure.* Here, learners receive KR for a trial after they complete performance on a later trial. Anderson, Magill, and Sekiya (1994) provided evidence for the effectiveness of this procedure. Participants practiced making a blindfolded aiming movement. One group received KR about distance error after every trial (delay-0). A second group received KR two trials later (delay-2), which meant that they were told their error for trial 1 after completing trial 3. Results (figure 15.9) were that while the delay condition hindered performance during practice, it led to better performance on a 24 hr retention test.
我们发现，在*练习-延迟程序*（trial-delay procedure）中存在与主观评价策略类似的效果。在练习延迟程序中，受试者在完成数次练习后才获得 KR。Anderson、Magill 和 Sekiya（1994）报告了类似的积极效果。实验的任务为戴眼罩练习瞄准。其中一组在每次练习后获得关于距离错误的 KR（延迟为 0）。第二组每两次练习后获得 KR（延迟为 2)，即在完成第 3 次练习结束后提供关于第 1 次练习的 KR。结果（如图 15.9 所示）显示尽管延迟条件不利于练习时绩效的提高，但是却导致了较好的 24 小时保留测试成绩。

Learning processes.What do these different effects of activity reveal about learning processes that occur during the KR-delay interval? During this time interval, the learner is actively engaged in learning processes involving activities such as developing an understanding of the task-intrinsic feedback and establishing essential error detection capabilities.
在理解 KR 延迟间隔期间发生的学习过程方面，这些插入活动产生的不同作用能为我们揭示什么？我们认为，在 KR 延迟间隔期间学习者积极地从事一些学习过程，比如，理解任务内在反馈、建立基本的错误觉察能力。

For instructional purposes, the most significant implication of the effects of activity during the ­KR-delay interval is that people who are practicing ­a skill can use a beneficial strategy after they ­complete the performance of a skill and before ­they ­receive augmented feedback. That is, they could verbally describe what they think they did wrong that led to a less than desired performance ­outcome.
对于教学，KR 延迟间隔插人活动产生多种作用的最显著意义在于，学习者在完成技能执行后，到从教师、教练和康复师那里获得追加反馈前，可以使用一个有益的策略。在获得追加反馈前，他们可以用语言描述与目标相比，得出自己执行中的错误有哪些。

**The Length of the Post-KR Interval**
**KR 后间隔的长度**

The significance of the post-KR interval is that it is during this period of time that the learner develops a plan of action for the next trial. This planning ­occurs during this interval because the learner now has available both task-intrinsic feedback and augmented feedback.
KR 后间隔的重要性在于个体在此期间制定即来练习的动作计划。计划活动发生在 KR 后间隔，因为此时个体既获得任务内在反馈又获得追加反馈。

If the learner processes critical skill learning ­information during the post-KR interval, we would expect there to be a minimum length for this interval. Although there is not an abundance of research that has investigated this issue, there is empirical evidence from many years ago that provided evidence that indeed, this interval can be too short (e.g., Gallagher & Thomas, 1980; Rogers, 1974; ­Weinberg, Guy, & Tupper, 1964). For optimal learning, a minimum amount of time is needed for the learner to engage in the learning processes ­required. Conversely, there is no evidence indicating an optimal length for the post-KR interval. Research consistently has shown no apparent upper limit for the length of this interval.
如果学习者在 KR 后间隔加工技能学习的关键信息，那么我们预期这一间隔存在最小长度。尽管没有足够的证据证实这一观点，但是也有一些实验研究显示确实这一间隔不应该过短（例如，Gallagher & Thomas, 1980; Rogers, 1974; Weinberg, Guy, & Tupper, 1964)。为了产生最佳学习效果，学习者确实需要有一定的时间从事学习信息的加工。相反，没有证据显示 KR 后间隔存在最适长度。研究一致显示 KR 后间隔没有明显的长度上限。

**Activity during the Post-KR Interval**
**KR 后间隔期间从事的活动**

The effect of engaging in activity is similar for the post-KR interval to that for the KR-delay interval. Depending on the type of activity, activity can have no effect on learning, interfere with learning, or benefit learning.
KR 后间隔插人活动产生的效果与 KR 延迟间隔插入活动的效果相似。取决于活动的类型，这些活动可以对学习无影响、干扰学习或利于学习。

The most common finding has been that activity during the post-KR interval *has no effect on skill learning.* The best example is in an experiment by Lee and Magill (1983) in which participants practiced making an arm movement in 1,050 msec. During each post-KR interval, one group attempted the same movement in 1,350 msec, one group engaged in a cognitive activity involving number guessing, and a third group did no activity. At the end of the practice trials, the two activity groups showed poorer performance than the no-activity group. However, this was a temporary perfor­mance effect rather than a learning effect: on a no-KR retention test, the three groups did not differ.
最普遍的结果是 KR 后间隔插入活动*不影响运动技能的学习*。最好的例子就是 Lee 和 Magill（1983）的研究，实验中受试者练习在 1050 毫秒内完成手臂移动任务。在每个 KR 后间隔，其中一组尝试 1350 毫秒内完成同样的运动，第二组从事数字猜谜的认知任务，第三组不插入活动。在练习阶段末，插入活动的两个组表现水平比无活动组差。然而，这只是暂时的表现水平而不是学习效果：在无 KR 的保留测试中，这三个组的表现无差异。

Several researchers have reported results indicating that activity during the post-KR interval *hinders learning.* Of these, only those by ­Benedetti and ­McCullagh (1987) and Swinnen (1990, experiment 3) included appropriate tests for learning. In both of these experiments, the interfering activity was a cognitive activity. Participants in the experiment by Benedetti and McCullagh engaged in a mathe­matics problem-solving task, whereas those in the experiment by Swinnen guessed the ­movement-time error of a lever movement the experimenter made during the post-KR interval.
一些研究还显示在 KR 后间隔插人活动*干扰运动技能的学习*。这些研究中，只有 Benedetti 和 McCullagh（1987）以及 Swinnen（1990，实验 3）的实验对学习效果进行了恰当的测量。在这两个实验中，干扰活动都是认知性活动。在 Benedetti 和 McCullagh 的实验中，受试者进行数学解题任务；在 Swinnen 的实验中，受试者猜测实验者在 KR 后间隔中进行的杆运动任务的运动时间误差。

Only one experiment (Magill, 1988) has demonstrated that *beneficial learning effects* can result from activity in the post-KR interval. Participants learned a two-component arm movement in which each component had its own criterion movement time. During the post-KR interval, one group had to learn two additional two-component movements, one group had to learn a mirror-tracing task, and a third group did not engage in activity. Results showed that the two groups that engaged in ­activity during the post-KR interval performed ­better than the no-activity group on a transfer test in which they learned a new two-component ­movement.
仅有一个实验（Magill, 1988）显示 KR 后间隔插入活动*有利于运动技能的学习*。受试者学习由两部分组成的手臂运动，每部分都有标准运动时间。在 KR 后间隔中，一组被试学习两个额外的两部分运动任务，第二组学习镜面追踪任务（mirror-tracing task），第三组不进行任务活动。结果显示，尽管在无 KR 的保留测试中各组间无显著性差异，但是 KR 后间隔从事活动的两组被试的迁移表现好于无活动组（迁移测试为学习一个新的两部分运动任务）。

What do these different effects of activity tell us about learning processes that occur during the post-KR interval? They support the view we discussed earlier that learners engage in important planning activities during this time period. They use this planning time to take into account the discrepancy between the task-intrinsic and the augmented feedback, to determine how to execute the next attempt at performing the skill. Much of this planning seems to require cognitive activity; we see this in the experiments showing that engaging in attention-demanding cognitive problem-solving activity during this interval hinders learning.
在理解 KR 后间隔期间发生的学习过程方面，这些插入活动产生的不同作用能为我们揭示什么？他们支持了我们前面探讨过的观点，即学习者在这个时间间隔中从事重要的计划活动。个体使用这段时间来解释任务内在反馈与追加反馈之间的差异，确定下次如何执行技能。大部分计划活动都需要认知活动的参与；报告 KR 后间隔从事认知问题解决活动不利于学习的实验提示了这一点。

**FREQUENCY OF PRESENTING AUGMENTED FEEDBACK**
**提供追加反馈的频率**
For many years, the view was that augmented feedback should be given during or after every practice trial (i.e., 100 percent frequency), because no learning occurred on trials without augmented feedback. However, beginning with the influential review and evaluation of the KR literature by Salmoni, Schmidt, and Walter (1984) and continuing to the present time, this traditional view has been revised as researchers have provided evidence that is contrary to predictions of that viewpoint.
长期以来人们认为应该在每次练习后都提供追加反馈（即 100%频率），因为没有追加反馈就不会有学习发生。然而，从 Salmoni、Schmidt 和 Walter（1984） 对 KR 研究文献进行的权威综述开始，根据众多研究提供的证据，这一传统观点已经得到了修正。

**The Reduced Frequency Benefit**
**降低频率的利处**

Sufficient research evidence has now accumulated for us to say confidently that the *optimal frequency for giving augmented feedback is not 100 percent*. The most influential evidence to support this conclusion was an experiment by Winstein and Schmidt (1990). They had participants practice producing the complex movement pattern shown in the top panel of figure 15.10 by moving a lever on a tabletop to manipulate a cursor on a computer monitor. During the two days of practice, participants received KR after either 100 percent or 50 percent of the trials. For the 50 percent condition, the experimenters used a *fading technique* in which they systematically reduced the KR frequency; they provided KR after each of the first twenty-two trials of each day, then had participants perform eight trials with no KR, then systematically reduced the frequency from eight to two trials for the remain­ing eight-trial blocks each day. The results of this ­experiment are presented in the bottom panel of fig­ure 15.10. In a no-KR retention test given one day later, the faded 50 percent frequency condition led to better retention performance than the 100 percent condition produced. In fact, people who had received KR after every practice trial showed ­retention test performance at a level resembling that of their first day of practice.
至今，大量研究证据使我们确信，*提供追加反馈的最佳频率不是 100%*。最早支持这一观点的是 Winstein 和 Schmidt （1990）的研究。他们让受试者练习图 15.10 上图所示的复杂运动，即移动桌面上的摇杆控制电脑显示器上的光标。在两天的练习期间，受试者获得 KR 的频率为 100% 或 50%。对于 50% 频率条件，实验者使用了衰减技术（fading technique)，系统地降低提供 KR 的频率；研究人员在每天的前 22 次练习后每次都提供 KR，之后的 8 次练习无 KR，在剩下的练习中系统地将 KR 频率降低（从每组练习提供 8 次降低到每组练习提供两次）。实验结果如图 15.10下图所示，在 1 天后的无 KR 保持测试中，与 100%频率条件相比，衰减 50%频率条件导致较好的表现水平。事实上，每次练习后都获得 KR 的个体其保留测试的表现水平与第一天练习时的表现水平相似。

The Winstein and Schmidt (1990) study has generated a great deal of research since it was published. The research has focused on two predominant themes: providing additional empirical support for the reduced frequency benefit, and determining whether or not an optimal frequency exists to enhance skill learning. Two interesting conclusions have resulted from these research efforts. First, although a reduced frequency of augmented feedback can benefit motor skill learning, it may *not* benefit the learning of all motor skills. Second, an optimal relative frequency appears to be specific to the skill being learned and likely also to the skill level of the learner (e.g., Guadagnoli & Lee, 2004).
Winstein 和 Schmidt（1990） 的论文发表后引发了一系列研究。这些研究主要有两个主题：为降低 KR 频率有利的观点积累更多的实验证据，以及是否存在有利于学习的最佳频率。从这些研究中可以得出两个有趣的结论：第一，尽管降低追加反馈频率可以促进运动技能的学习，但是并不一定有利于所有运动技能的学习；第二，是否存在最佳的相对频率似乎要根据所学习的运动技能来确定。

**Theoretical Implications of the Frequency Effect**
**频率效果的理论意义**

The challenge for those interested in developing motor learning theory is to establish why giving augmented feedback less than 100 percent of the time during practice is better for skill learning. One possible reason is that when people receive augmented feedback after every trial, they eventually experience an attention-capacity “overload.” After several trials, the cumulative effect is that there is more information available than the person can handle.
为什么低于 100%频率的追加反馈有利于学习？这对运动技能学习理论研究者是个挑战。一种原因可能是学习者在每次练习后获得追加反馈，会使他们注意资源超负荷。多次冻习后，这种效果的累秋就是信息过多，超出了学习者所能掌握的能力。

A more likely possibility is that giving augmented feedback on every trial leads to engaging the learner in a fundamentally different type of learning processing than he or she would experience if it were not given on every trial. Schmidt and his colleagues (e.g., Salmoni, Schmidt, & Walter, 1984; Winstein & Schmidt, 1990) proposed this view, which they called the **guidance hypothesis.** According to this hypothesis, if the learner receives augmented feedback on every trial (i.e., at 100 percent frequency), then it will effectively “guide” the learner to perform the movement correctly. However, there is a negative aspect to this guidance process. By using augmented feedback as the guidance source, the learner ­develops a dependency on the availability of augmented feedback so that when he or she must perform the skill without it, performance suffers. In effect, augmented feedback becomes a crutch for the learner that is essential for performing the skill.
更有可能是由于是否提供追加反馈使个体经历不同类型的学习过程。Schmidt 及其同事（例如，Salmoni, Schmidt, & Walter, 1984; Winstein & Schmidt, 1990) 提出了这一观点，并称其为**指导假说**（guidance hypothesis）。根据这一假说，如果学习者在每次练习后获得追加反馈（100%频率），那么从效果上讲，追加反馈将引导个体正确地执行技能。然而，这种引导过程有负面效应。将追加反馈作为引导源，学习者将对其产生依赖。因此，当个体需要在无追加反馈条件下独立执行时，表现水平会下降。在效果上，追加反馈成为学习者执行技能必需的拐杖。

The hypothesis further proposes that receiving augmented feedback less frequently during practice encourages the learner to engage in more beneficial learning strategies during practice. For example, active cognitive and movement problem-solving activities increase during trials with no augmented feedback and learners are more likely to process task-intrinsic sources of feedback (Anderson, Magill, Sekiya, & Ryan, 2005). The learner does not become dependent on the availability of augmented feedback and therefore can perform the skill well, even in its absence. (For an extensive review of research investigating the guidance hypothesis and an experiment that provides support for it, see Maslovat, Brunke, Chua, & Franks, 2009; for a more undated review, see Sigrist et al., 2013.)
该假说进一步指出在练习中以较低频率提供追加反馈可以鼓励个体在练习中从事更有益的学习策略。例如，在不提供追加反馈的练习中，个体积极的问题解决活动增加，增大了他们使用任务内在反馈的可能性（Anderson, Magill, Sekiya, & Ryan, 2005）。学习者不会形成对追加反馈的依赖，因此在即使不提供追加反馈时，个体仍能够很好地执行技能。（关于探究指导假说的研究和为其提供支持的实验的综述，见 Maslovat, Brunke, Chua, & Franks, 2009；更近一些的综述可以参考 Sigrist et al., 2013。）【此处原文笔误，应该为 updated 而不是 undated，要不然 make no sense】

**TECHNIQUES THAT REDUCE AUGMENTED FEEDBACK FREQUENCY**
**降低追加反馈频率的技术**

Now that we have established that it is generally more effective to provide augmented feedback less frequently than on every practice trial, a question that remains concerns how to implement ways that reduce frequency. The fading technique, described in the previous section, is one useful approach to reducing frequency. But several other techniques are effective as well.
现在我们认识到提供较低频率的追加反馈更利于学习。那么，具体如何降低追加反馈的频率呢？前面描述的衰减技术是一种非常有用的降低频率的方法。当然还有其他几种有效的技术。

**Performance-Based Bandwidths**
**表现带宽**

Earlier in this chapter we discussed a strategy for presenting augmented feedback that involved providing it only when a person’s performance error was larger than a predetermined amount. We referred to this strategy as giving augmented feedback according to *performance-based bandwidths*. If we relate this bandwidth technique to the augmented feedback frequency issue, we can see how the bandwidth technique influences the frequency of presenting augmented feedback.
在本章的前面，我们讨论了一种提供追加反馈的策略，即只有当执行者的表现错误大于预定量时才提供追加反馈。我们称这种策略为根据*基于表现带宽*（performance-based bandwidths）提供追加反馈。如果将这种带宽技术与追加反馈频率问题联系起来，我们可以看到带宽技术如何影响提供追加反馈的频率。

Lee, White, and Carnahan (1990) were the first to investigate this relationship. In their experiment they paired individual participants so that one of each pair received KR only on the trials on which the other of the pair received KR in 5 percent and 10 percent bandwidth conditions. The reason for the pairing of participants (a procedure known as “yoking”) was to control for the possibility that the performance-based bandwidth benefit for learning was purely due to a reduced KR frequency. Thus, KR frequency was the same for each pair of participants, but the KR frequency for the participant in the bandwidth condition depended on their performance relative to the 5 and 10 percent criteria. Results showed that the bandwidth-based KR conditions led to better retention perfor­mance and the retention benefit was primarily due to a reduction in KR frequency.
Lee、White 和 Carnahan（1990）首先探讨了这种关系。在实验中，他们将受试者配对，这样只有当其中一个受试者在 5%或 10%带宽条件下获得 KR 时，配对的受试者才能获得 KR。这样配对的原因是（称为 yoking 程序）为了能够将利于学习的效果解释为 KR 频率的降低。这样配对被试之间的 KR 频率是一样的。但是，在带宽条件下的被试获得 KR 的频率取决于 5%和 10%的带宽标准。结果显示，表现带宽 KR 条件提高保留测试成绩，这种提高主要是 KR 频率降低导致的。

Two additional experiments will serve as examples of research that provide support for the learning benefit derived from the relationship between the performance-based bandwidth technique and augmented feedback frequency. Goodwin and ­Meeuwsen (1995) compared 0 percent and 10 percent error bandwidth conditions with those that were systematically expanded (0-5-10-15-20 ­percent) and contracted (20-15-10-5-0 percent) for learning to putt a golf ball a criterion distance. The two conditions that resulted in the best retention test performance showed interesting KR frequencies. The frequencies for the 10 percent bandwidth condition reduced from 62 percent during the first twenty trials, to between 47 percent and 50 percent on the remaining trials. For the expanding bandwidth ­condition, KR frequencies began at 99 percent for the first twenty trials when the bandwidth was 0 percent, but then eventually reduced to 19 percent by the end of the practice trials, as the bandwidths increased in size. Lai and Shea (1999) reported similar findings for the learning of a complex spatial-temporal movement pattern. These results indicate that for the performance-based bandwidth technique it is the reduction of KR frequency during practice that is important to improved learning.
另外有两个研究可以帮助我们更好地理解表现带宽技术与追加反馈频率之间的关系。Goodwin 和 Meeuwsen（1995）在实验中，比较了 0%和 10%表现带宽条件与系统扩展带宽（0-5 -10-15-20%）和收缩带宽（20-15- 10-5-0%）条件对学习高尔夫推球任务的效用。保持绩效最好的两个组的练习条件显示了特殊的 KR 频率。10%带宽条件将追加反馈的频率从前 20 次练习的 62%降低到 47%~50%之间。对于扩展带宽条件，当带宽为 0%时 KR 频率在前 20 次练习中是 99%，但是随着带宽范围的增大，在练习末 KR 频率降低到 19%。这些结果显示 KR 频率的降低对于提高学习更为重要。Lai 和 Shea（1999）在复杂空间一时间运动模式学习任务的实验中也得出了相似的结果。这些结果表明，对于表现带宽技术来说，在实践中降低KR频率对于提高学习是重要的。

From an instructional perspective, the bandwidth technique provides a useful means of *individualizing the systematic reduction of the frequency of augmented feedback* in practice situations. The bandwidth technique gives the practitioner a specific guideline for when to provide augmented feedback that encourages the learner to engage in important learning strategies. And because the bandwidth is ­related to individual performance, the learner can engage in these strategies at his or her own rate.
从教学的角度看，带宽技术是一种针对个体系统降低追加反馈频率的有效手段。带宽技术对实践者的提示是应该鼓励学习者从事重要的学习策略制定，而且由于带宽与个体的执行相关，学习者可以根据自己的情况制定这些学习策略。

**Self-Selected Frequency**
**自我选择的频率**

Another technique that bases the frequency of augmented feedback on the individual involves the learner *receiving augmented feedback only when he or she asks for it*. The learning benefits derived from this approach appear to result from the learner participating more actively in determining characteristics of the practice conditions by self-regulating the presentation of augmented feedback. An experiment by Janelle, Kim, and Singer (1995) provided initial evidence that this strategy can enhance the learn­ing of motor skills. College students practiced an underhand golf ball toss to a target on the ground. The students received KP about ball force, ball loft, and arm swing during practice. Compared to groups that received KP according to experimenter-determined frequencies (all of which received it less frequently than on every trial), the participants who controlled KP frequency themselves performed more accurately on the retention test.
另外一种针对个体降低追加反馈频率的技术是当学习者*要求提供追加反馈时再提供反馈*。这种技术有利于学习似乎是由于个体更加积极地参与到练习条件的制定过程中。Janelle、Kim 和Singer（1995）的实验提供了最初的证据，这种策略可以促进运动技能的学习。大学生练习向地面上的目标低手投掷高尔夫球。学生在练习中获得关于抛球力量、球飞行轨迹和挥臂等 KP 信息。与获得由实验者确定频率的 KP 组相比，自己控制频率的 KP 组在保留测试中表现得更为准确。

Janelle substantiated and extended these results in a later study in which videotape replay was a source of augmented feedback in addition to verbal KP (Janelle, Barba, Frehlich, Tennant, & Cau­raugh, 1997). Participants in the self-regulated group ­controlled the augmented feedback schedule by requesting KP at will during 200 practice trials. An important characteristic of this experiment was that individual participants in another group were paired (i.e., yoked) to participants in the self-regulated condition to receive KP on the same 
trials, but without requesting it. The importance of this yoked condition was to control for the possibility that the effect of self-regulation of augmented feedback is due only to reduced frequency. Results showed that participants in the self-regulated condition learned the throwing accuracy task with more accuracy and better throwing technique than participants in the other KP and yoked conditions.
Janelle 在后来使用录像演示和语言 KP 提供追加反馈的研究中证实并扩展了这一结果（Janelle, Barba, Frehlich, Tennant, & Cau­raugh, 1997）。自我调节组的被试通过在 200 次练习中按照自己的意愿要求提供 KP，来控制提供追加反馈的策略。该实验有一个重要特征是另外组的被试与自我调节组的被试配对（yoked），前者在后者获得 KP 时，也获得 KP，只不过并不是出于被试自己的意愿。配对技术控制了将追加反馈自我调节的实验结果仅解释为降低追加反馈频率导致。结果显示，自我调节条件的被试投掷技术和精确性都好于其他 KP 以及配对 KP 条件的被试。

In terms of augmented feedback frequency, it is interesting to note that participants in the 
self-­controlled condition requested KP on only 
7 percent of the practice trials in the Janelle et al. (1995) experiment, and on only 11 percent in the Janelle et al. (1997) experiment. These low frequencies indicate that there is some relationship between the self-controlled procedure and the reduced relative frequency of augmented feedback. However, because people in the self-controlled conditions in both experiments performed better on retention tests than those in the frequency-yoked conditions, the benefit of the self-controlled situation is more than a simple frequency effect.
就追加反馈频率而言，Janelle 等人（1995）报告，自我控制条件的被试仅在 7%的练习要求提供 KP，在詹尼雷（Janellet 等，1997) 的实验中，仅在 11% 的练习中要求提供 KP。这样低的频率提示自我控制程序与降低追加反馈相对频率之间存在一定的联系。然而，由于 Janellet 两个实验自我控制条件的个体在保持测试中的绩效都好于频率配对组，因此自我控制条件带来的学习效应并不仅仅是简单降低频率的效果。

Why do beginners ask for feedback from 
an ­instructor? In one of the first experiments to address this question Chiviakowsky and Wulf (2002) asked participants in an experiment involving the learning of a sequen­tial timing task to respond to the question “When/why did you ask for feedback?” Two-thirds of the participants answered that it was after what they considered to be a good trial (i.e., a trial during which they thought their perfor­mance was relatively successful). None indicated they asked for feedback after what they thought was a bad trial. Similar findings have been reported by these researchers in two additional experiments ­(Chiviakowsky & Wulf, 2005, 2007). Additionally, in a study by Laughlin et al. (2015), beginners practiced a three-ball cascade juggling task. The participants who asked for KR, typically asked after good trials primarily to confirm their success. Those who asked for KP, asked after 
both good and bad trials, primarily to identify technique flaws.
初学者为什么会向指导者要求提供反馈？Chiviakowsky 和 Wulf（2002）在学习序列时机任务情境中探讨了这一问题。要求每名被试填写问卷：“何时或为什么你要求提供反馈？”2/3的被试回答说在他们认为好的练习后要求提供反馈。没有人回答会在不好的执行后要求提供反馈。研究人员在另外两个实验中报告了类似的发现（Chiviakowsky & Wulf, 2005, 2007）。此外，在 Laughlin 等人（2015）的一项研究中，初学者练习三球杂耍任务。要求KR的受试者，基本都是在成功尝试之后才要求，主要是为了确认他们的成功。那些要求KP的受试者，在成功的和失败的尝试后都要求，主要是为了识别技术缺陷。

Research showing that learning is enhanced when learners can select when they want augmented feedback, and the fact that this selection typically occurs after trials that are thought to be relatively successful, provides interesting insight into the role of augmented feedback in skill learning. In general these results indicate the importance of augmented feedback as a source of information to confirm a learner’s subjective evaluation of his or her performance. Two points are especially relevant from these findings. *First*, the use of augmented feedback in this way allows beginners to engage in their own problem-solving strategies as they learn the skill. *Second*, these results provide excellent evidence that learners use augmented feedback as a source of motivation to continue to practice. When they perform a relatively successful trial they ask for augmented feedback to reinforce their own subjective evaluation of their performance, which encourages them to continue to practice the skill. (For a more in-depth discussion of why receiving augmented feedback after good trials benefits learning, see Carter, Smith, & Ste-Marie, 2016 and Chiviakowsky & Wulf, 2007.)
研究表明，当学习者可以选择何时需要追加反馈时，学习效果就会得到加强，而且这种选择通常发生在相对成功的尝试之后，这一事实为追加反馈在技能学习中的作用提供了有趣的见解。总的来说，这些结果表明了增强反馈作为信息来源的重要性，帮助学习者确认对自己表现的主观评价。这些发现中有两点特别重要。*首先*，以这种方式使用追加反馈允许初学者在学习技能的同时参与到他们自己的问题解决策略中。*第二*，这些结果提供了极好的证据，证明学习者使用追加反馈作为继续练习的动力来源。当他们进行相对成功的尝试时，他们会要求更多的反馈来加强他们对自己表现的主观评价，这鼓励他们继续练习技能。(关于为什么在成功的尝试后接受更多的反馈有益于学习的更深入的讨论，见 Carter, Smith, & Ste-Marie, 2016 and Chiviakowsky & Wulf, 2007)

**Summary and Averaged Augmented Feedback**
**小结和平均追加反馈**

Another way to reduce the frequency of augmented feedback presentations is to give a listing of ­performance-related information after a certain number of practice trials. This technique, which is known as *summary augmented feedback,* reduces the presentation frequency of augmented feedback while providing the same amount of information as if it were given after every trial.
另一种降低追加反馈频率的方法是在一定次数的练习后，向学习者提供一个表现信息的清单。这一技术被称为*小结追加反馈*（summary augmented feedback），可以降低提供追加反馈的频率，但却提供与 100%追加反馈相同数量的信息。

The summary technique could be advantageous in several types of skill learning situations. For ­example, suppose that a therapy patient must do a series of ten leg extensions in relatively rapid succession. To give augmented feedback after every extension may not be possible, if time limits restrict access to performance information after each attempt. A summary of all ten attempts could help overcome this limitation. Or suppose that a person is practicing a shooting skill for which he or she cannot see the target because of the distance involved. Efficiency of practice could be increased if that person did not receive augmented feedback after each shot, but received information about each shot after every ten shots.
小结技术可以利于多种运动技能的学习。例如，康复患者需要快速连续地完成 10 个腿伸展运动。如果每次练习后时间有限，就不可能每次都提供追加反馈。提供整个 10 次练习的小结追加反馈可以解决这个问题，或者假设个体练习射击技能，由于距离比较远个体无法看到目标。如果在每次射击后不提供追加反馈，但每 10 次练习后获得关于这 10 次练习的信息，可以提高练习的有效性。

The first study to generate a great deal of interest in the summary technique was a laboratory-based experiment by Schmidt, Young, Swinnen, and Shapiro (1989). The task involved moving a lever along a trackway to achieve a goal movement time. During the practice trials, participants received KR after every trial or in summary form after five, ten, or fifteen trials. The results of this experiment (see figure 15.11) showed very little difference between the conditions during practice and on a retention test given 10 min after practice. But on a retention test two days later, the group that had received KR after every trial performed the worst, whereas the group that had received summary KR after every ­fifteen trials performed the best.
引起广泛研究兴趣的首例小结技术实验来自于Schmidt、Young、Swinnen 和 Shapiro （1989）。实验任务是在目标时间内沿着轨道移动执行杆。在练习期间，被试每次练习后获得 KR 或者每 5 次、10 次、15 次练习后获得小结 KR。这一实验的结果（见图 15.11）显示，在练习和 10 分钟后，保持测试中各组绩效差异微弱，在两天后的保持测试中，每次获得 KR 组的绩效最差，而每 15 次练习后获得小结 KR 组绩效最好。

In an experiment involving the learning of target shooting with rifles, Boyce (1991) provided one group with KP after every shot, and another group with KP about every shot after each fifth shot. The results showed no difference in eventual shooting performance by these groups. Although the summary method did not yield better performance than the method giving KP after every shot, its effectiveness as an instructional technique was established, because it was just as effective 
for improving performance as the other method.
在一个步枪射击技能学习的实验中，Boyce（1991）在每次练习后对一组受试者提供 KP，另外一组受试者在每 15 次练习后获得小结 KP。结果显示两组在最后的射击表现上无显著差异。尽管小结方法没有导致比每次练习后提供追加反馈更好的学习效果，但是小结技术却是一种有效的教学手段，因为在提供信息方面这种技术与其他手段同样有效。

Numerous studies have provided evidence ­supporting the benefit of the summary technique for motor skill learning (e.g., Guay, Salmoni, & Lajoie, 1999; Herbert, Heiss, & Basso, 2008; Schmidt, Lange, & Young, 1990; Wright, Snowden, & 
Willoughby, 1990). However, a very practical ­question remains to be answered: What is the optimal number of performance attempts, or practice trials, to include in a summary augmented feedback statement? Although there have been several attempts to determine whether a specific number of trials is optimal, the results have been equivocal. Two answers appear reasonable at the present time on the basis of results of research that has investigated this question.
20 世纪 90 年代发表的一些研究，支持了小结技术在运动技能学习情境中的有效性（例如，Guay, Salmoni, & Lajoie, 1999; Herbert, Heiss, & Basso, 2008; Schmidt, Lange, & Young, 1990; Wright, Snowden, &Willoughby, 1990)。然而，有一个更实际的问题需要回答，那就是小结追加反馈中所包含的最佳练习次数应该是多少？尽管有些研究试图探讨这一问题，但结果却是模糊的。根据相关的研究，现在看来有两种回答可能是合理的。

First, Sidaway, Moore, and Schoenfelder-Zohdi (1991) concluded that the positive effects of the summary technique are not due to the number of trials summarized, and stated that their results argue against the notion of an “optimal summary length.” Instead, they argued that the summary effect is related either to the reduced frequency of presenting augmented feedback or to the trials delay involved in presenting augmented feedback using the summary technique (note that the summary technique has characteristics similar to the trials-delay procedure, which we discussed earlier in this chapter).
首先，Sidaway、Moore 和 Schoenfelder-Zohdi（1991） 认为，小结技术的积极效果并不是由于小结追加反馈中包括的练习数量，而且他们的实验结果不支持“最佳小结长度（optimal summary length）”的说法。相反，他们认为，小结技术的效果应该与提供追加反馈频率的降低有关，或者与提供追加反馈时间的延迟相关（注：小结技术与练习延迟程序有相似之处）。

An alternative answer is one we have seen related to many of the issues discussed in this book. The “optimal” summary length may be specific to the skill being learned. Guadagnoli, Dornier, and Tandy (1996) provided evidence for this possibility by showing that longer summaries are better for the learning of simple skills, whereas shorter summaries lead to better learning of more complex skills.
另外一种解释与我们在本书探讨的很多问题都有联系。最佳小结长度与所学习技能的类型有关。Guadagnoli、Dornier 和 Tandy（1996）为这一观点提供了证据，他们报告简单技能的小结长度较长，而较短的追加小结长度更适合于较复杂的技能。

One of the possible strategies people may use when presented with a listing of augmented feedback is to *estimate an average for the series of trials* that the summary includes. The research literature provides some evidence that this may occur. In experiments in which the learner receives the average score for all the trials in a series, the ­results have shown that this procedure leads to ­better learning than presenting augmented feedback after every trial (Young & Schmidt, 1992), and no better or worse than after every trial or after every third trial (Wulf & Schmidt, 1996). But when compared to the summary technique, no differences are found in terms of their influence on skill learning (Guay, Salmoni, & Lajoie, 1999; Weeks & Sherwood, 1994; Yao, Fischman, & Wang, 1994).
当个体获得小结追加反馈时，可能采用的策略之一是*估计这些练习的平均水平*。已经有研究证实了这种可能性。在学习者获得系列练习平均分数的实验中，这种程序导致了比 100%频率追加反馈更好的学习效果（Young & Schmidt, 1992），以及与 100%频率追加反馈、每 3 次练习提供小结追加反馈条件间无差异（Wulf & Schmidt, 1996)。但是与小结技术相比较，在对运动技能学习影响方面两者之间无差异（Guay, Salmoni, & Lajoie, 1999; Weeks & Sherwood, 1994; Yao, Fischman, & Wang, 1994)。

Finally, *why are these two feedback presentation methods effective?* Their effectiveness is undoubtedly due to the same factors that lead to the benefit of reducing augmented feedback frequency, as explained by the guidance hypothesis. During practice trials on which they receive no augmented feedback, people engage in beneficial learning ­activities that are not characteristic of people who receive augmented feedback after every trial.
最后，*为什么这两种提供追加反馈的方法是有效的呢*？无疑应该归结为相同的因素，即都降低了提供追加反馈的频率，与指导假说的预测相一致。在没有获得追加反馈的练习中，个体从事有益的学习活动，而这些特征是 100%追加反馈频率个体所不具备的。

**SUMMARY**
**总结**

Augmented feedback is performance-related feedback that is provided by an external source; it adds to or enhances *task-intrinsic feedback,* which is performance-related feedback directly available to the sensory system during the performance of a skill.
追加反馈是由外界提供的、与执行相关的反馈；它有助于增强*任务内在反馈*，后者是执行技能过程中，个体通过自身感觉系统直接获得的与执行相关的反馈。

Two types of augmented feedback are distinguished based on the aspect of performance to which the information refers:
根据追加反馈提供信息的侧重点不同，可以将其分为两类：

*Knowledge of results (KR)* refers to the outcome of an attempt to perform a skill.
*KR* 提供关于技能执行结果的信息。

*Knowledge of performance (KP)* refers to the movement-related characteristics associated with an attempt to perform a skill.
*KP* 提供提供导致表现结果的运动特征信息。

Augmented feedback plays two roles in the skill learning process:
追加反馈在运动技能学习过程中起着两种作用：

It facilitates achievement of the task goal.
促进达到技能动作目标。

It motivates the learner to continue to strive ­toward the achievement of a goal.
激励学习者向达到目标持续努力。

The need for augmented feedback for skill learning can be described in four different ways:
运动技能学习中提供追加反馈的必要性，可从以下四个不同的方面描述：

It can be essential for skill learning.
对于运动技能学习是必不可少的。

It may not be essential for skill learning.
运动技能学习不一定需要追加反馈。

It can enhance skill learning beyond what is possible without it.
提供追加反馈可以比不提供更能促进运动技能的学习。

It can hinder skill learning.
提供追加反馈可以阻碍运动技能的学习

Augmented feedback content issues include the following:
与追加反馈内容相关的议题有以下几方面：

Should the information conveyed to the learner refer to the errors made or to those ­aspects of the performance that were correct?
追加反馈传递给学习者的信息，应该指向错误的方面还是执行正确的方面？

Should the augmented feedback be KR or KP?
应该提供 KR 还是 KP？

Should the augmented feedback be quantitative or qualitative?
应该提供定量的还是定性的追加反馈？

Should the augmented feedback be based on the size of the error(s) and/or number of errors?
追加反馈应该基于错误的大小还是错误的数量？

What is the effect of erroneous augmented feedback on skill learning?
错误的追加反馈对运动技能学习的影响如何？

KP can be presented to the learner in several 
different forms:
向学习者提供 KP 的方式有以下几种：

Manual guidance, which involves physically moving a body part through a movement or to a movement position.
手动指导，包括按一定动作移动身体部位或将身体部位移动到标准位置。

Verbal KP, which can provide either descriptive or prescriptive information.
语言 KP，可以提供描述性信息或说明性信息。

Video replays of skill performances.
技能执行的录像演示。

Movement kinematics and kinetics associated with an attempt to perform a skill.
与技能执行相关的动作的运动学分析。

Biofeedback.
生物反馈。

In addition to giving augmented feedback after a person has completed a trial, or after the performance of a skill (i.e., *terminal augmented feedback*), it can be presented during the performance (i.e., *concurrent augmented feedback*).
除了在个体完成一次练习或执行后提供追加反馈（即*末端追加反馈*）外，还可以在个体执行的过程中提供追加反馈（即*同步追加反馈*）。

Concurrent augmented feedback can have negative and positive effects on skill learning.
同步追加反馈对运动技能学习的影响存在积极和消极两个方面。

Two intervals of time associated with terminal augmented feedback are the KR-delay interval and the post-KR interval. Both require a minimum length of time, although a maximum length has not been determined. Engaging in activity during these intervals can hinder, benefit, or have no effect on skill learning.
与末端追加反馈相关的两个时间间隔是 KR 延迟间隔和 KR 后间隔。尽管没有证实这两个间隔的时间长度存在最大值，但却都要求有最小的时间长度。在这两个时间间隔中插入活动可以阻碍、促进运动技能的学习或对运动技能学习无影响。

Research indicates that the optimal frequency for giving augmented feedback is less than on every practice trial. The guidance hypothesis represents the most commonly held view for explaining the learning benefit of a reduced frequency.
研究证据显示提供追加反馈的最佳频率并不是在每次练习后 100%提供。指导假说代表了解释降低追加反馈频率利于运动技能学习的普遍观点。

Several techniques will reduce augmented feedback frequency:
降低追加反馈频率的技术如下：

Performance-based bandwidths.
表现带宽。

Performer-selected frequency.
学习者自主选择频率。

Summary and averaged augmented feedback.
小结和平均追加反馈。

**POINTS FOR THE PRACTITIONER**

Evaluate the need for KR or KP in any skill instruction situation in terms of the type of augmented feedback that would most effectively facilitate learning the skill.
根据能最有效促进当前技能学习的强化反馈类型，评估在当前指导情境下提供 KP 还是 KR。

More specific or technologically sophisticated augmented feedback is not necessarily better. ­Be­ginners need feedback that will help them make a “ballpark” approximation of the movements they need to make to achieve the action goal.
更具体或更复杂的追加反馈不一定更好。新手只需要能帮助他们大致完成动作目标的反馈。

Augmented feedback that is a combination of ­error-correction information and information about what was done correctly can be helpful for skill acquisition and motivation to continue to try to achieve the goal of the task.
追加反馈提供的是纠错信息、有助于技能习得的正确做法和继续努力实现任务目标的动机。

Determine the verbal KP to give according to the most critical error made during a practice attempt. Identify this error on the basis of an analysis of the skill’s component parts and a prioritized list of the importance of each part for achieving the ­action goal.
根据练习中最严重的错误，确定要给出的语言KP。根据对技能组成部分的分析以及每个部分对实现行动目标的重要性的优先程度来确定这个错误。

Prescriptive verbal KP is better than descriptive verbal KP for beginners.
对于初学者来说，说明性的语言 KP 比描述性的语言 KP 更有益。

Video replays can be effective as augmented feedback for beginners when you point out errors and provide information about how to correct them. The decision to provide this type of information for more skilled individuals can be based on the individual’s choice.
当你指出错误并提供如何改正错误的信息时，视频回放对初学者来说是有效的补充反馈。是否要为熟练个体提供这种类型的信息可以取决于他们的选择。

Computer-generated displays of the kinematics of a skill performance will be more effective for learners who are at a more advanced stage of learning than a beginner.
对于进阶学习者来说，关于技能表现的运动学特征的计算机生成图像将更有效。

Biofeedback can facilitate skill learning when it provides information people can use to alter movements and when they do not ­become dependent on its availability.
当生物反馈提供人们可以用来改变动作的信息时，并且当不会让学习者产生依赖时，可以促进技能学习。

Do not feel compelled to give augmented feedback after every practice attempt. When you ­do not give augmented feedback, you provide ­opportunities for people to determine what their own sensory feedback tells them about perfor­m­ing the skill they are learning.
不要觉得在每次练习后都必须给出更多的反馈。当你不提供追加反馈时，学习者就会通过自身感官来获得技能执行状况的反馈。

The performance-bandwidth strategy of providing augmented feedback can be especially useful when instructing groups of individuals where it is difficult to interact with each person individually on every performance attempt.
在指导一群学习者时，如果很难在每次练习后和每个人进行单独的互动，那么使用表现带宽来提供追加反馈将是一种很有效的策略。

Allow people you are working with to determine when they would like to receive KR or KP.
允许你的学员自己决定是要接受 KR 还是 KP。

On occasion, ask the people you are working with to tell you what movement errors they made and how they should correct them before you give them this information.
偶尔在给出学员纠错意见前，先让他们自己说说自己犯了什么错以及应该如何修正。
