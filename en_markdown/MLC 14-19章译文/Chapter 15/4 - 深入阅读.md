**Augmented Feedback as Motivation**
**追加反馈起到动机的作用**

An instructor can use augmented feedback to influence a person’s perception of his or her own ability in a skill. This is an effective way to influence the person’s motivation to continue pursuing a task goal or performing a skill. The verbal statement “You’re doing a lot better” can indicate to a person that he or she is being successful at an activity. Evidence supporting the motivational effectiveness of this type of verbal feedback comes from research relating to self-efficacy and performance of skills.
指导者可以用追加反馈来影响个体对操作技能自我效能的知觉。这是一种有效的方法，可以激发个体的动机，去继续追求任务目标或操作技能。“你做得非常棒。”可以提示个体从事活动非常成功。来自自我效能和运动表现的相关证据支持此类语言反馈的动机效应。

For example, Solmon and Boone (1993) showed that in a physical education class environment, students with high ability perceptions demonstrated longer persistence at performing a skill and had higher performance expectations than those with low ability perceptions. More recently, çvila and her colleagues (çvila et al., 2012) showed that social comparative feedback about performance (which in this study involved providing a bogus performance score that was above the average score of all the participants) resulted in higher perceived competence for 10-year-old children for accuracy for throwing a beanbag while blindfolded at a circular target on the floor. In her reviews of self-efficacy research as it relates to skill performance, Feltz (1992; Feltz & Payment, 2005) concluded that the success or failure of past performance is a key mediator of a person’s self-perceptions regarding ability.
例如，Solmon 和 Boone (1993) 报告，在体育教学情境中，与自我效能低的个体相比，自我效能高的学生在技能操作上表现出更长的持久性和更高的预期值。最近，çvila 和她的同事（çvila et al., 2012）表明，表现的社会比较反馈（social comparative feedback about performance）导致10岁儿童在蒙眼睛向地板上的圆形目标投掷任务中的准确性更高（在这项实验中，研究人员会提供一个高于所有受试者平均分数的虚假分数）。同时，Feltz （1992）根据她关于自我效能与技能表现关系的观点，主张过去执行成功与否的经历是调解个体自我效能的关键因素。

Visual augmented feedback has also been shown to have motivational benefits for learning motor skills. An interesting example comes from its use in a physical therapy context. People with neurological gait disorders reported that the addition of visual augmented feedback about their performance on a Lokomat driven gait orthosis (a robotic-assisted gait training device) made them more motivated to train on the device than when this additional feedback was not provided (Banz, Bollinger, Colombo, Dietz, & LŸnenburger, 2008). 
视觉追加反馈也被证明对学习运动技能有激励作用。一个有趣的例子来自它在物理治疗中的应用。患有神经性步态障碍的患者报告说，Lokomat 驱动步态矫形器（一种辅助步态训练的设备）增加了关于他们表现的视觉追加反馈，提高了他们在设备上进行训练的动力（Banz, Bollinger, Colombo, Dietz, & LŸnenburger, 2008）。

An important implication of these findings is that the practitioner can present augmented feedback in a way that influences a person’s feelings of success or failure which, in turn, influence a person to continue or to stop his or her involvement in participating in a physical activity.
这些发现的一个重要意义是，指导者提供的追加反馈可以让练习者产生失败感或成功感，这反过来影响练习者的态度，让他们倾向于继续或停止该体育活动。

**Teacher Feedback Relationships in Physical Education Classes**
**在体育教学课中的教师反馈关系**

Silverman, Woods, and Subramaniam (1999) examined the relationship between teacher feedback and several different practice and performance characteristics for eight classes of middle school physical ­education. Although each teacher taught one activity, the eight classes involved a variety of activities: volleyball, soccer, badminton, basketball, and ultimate. The teachers were videotaped for two classes in a row in which motor skill was the focus of instruction. The researchers observed the videotapes and recorded characteristics of several different teacher behavior categories, including teacher feedback. Among the various results of the analysis of the data from this study was the finding that *the amount of teacher feedback given to students was significantly correlated with the amount of appropriate practice in which students engaged,* regardless of skill level. These results indicate that even though research has shown that teacher feedback and skill achievement are not highly correlated, teacher feedback has a positive impact on the students’ participation in class by influencing them to engage in activity that is appropriate for helping them learn the skills that are the focus of the class instruction.
Silverman、Wood 和 Subramaniam (1999) 探讨了 8 个中学体育教学班中，教师反馈与不同练习、绩效特征之间的关系。尽管，每位教师教授一个活动，这 8 个班学习了排球、足球、羽毛球、篮球等技术。教师连续拍摄了两个班的技能操作动作，其中运动技能是指导的重点。研究者观看录像带，并记录教师不同技术动作的特点，包括教师反馈。这一研究的结果是*无论个体的技能水平如何，教师反馈数量与个体从事的正确练习数量显著相关*。这些结果提示，即使研究显示教师反馈与技能获得之间并不存在高相关，但是教师在课堂上提供反馈指导的目的在于，使学生进行利于技能获得的有效练习，因此教师反馈影响学生在课堂上的参与情况。

**KP about Certain Features of a Skill Helps Correct Other Features**
**关于技能某些特征的 KP 有助于纠正其他特征**

Participants in an experiment by den Brinker, Stabler, Whiting, and van Wieringen (1986) learned to perform on the slalom ski simulator, like the one illustrated in the preceding chapter in figure 14.2. Their three-part goal was to move the platform from left to right as far as possible at a specific high frequency, and with a motion that was as fluid as possible. On the basis of these performance goals, three groups received different types of information as KP after each trial: the *distance* they had moved the platform, how close they were to performing at the criterion platform movement *frequency,* and how fluid their movements were (i.e., *fluency*). All three groups practiced for four days, performing six 1.5 min trials each day, with a test trial before and after each day’s practice trials.
在 den Brinker、Stabler、Whiting 和 van Wieringen (1986) 的研究中，被试学习在障碍滑雪模拟器上操作。他们的三段目标是：以较高的频率向左和右尽可能地滑远，并且动作要流畅。根据这些操作目标，三个组在每次练习后都获得不同类型的信息作为 KP。主试告诉其中一组被试移动的*距离*；告诉第二组与平台移动目标*频率*的接近程度；告诉第三组被试运动*流畅程度*。所有被试练习 4 天，每天练习 6 次，每次练习持续 1.5 分钟，每天练习开始前和结束后都进行测试。

Early in practice, the type of KP an individual received influenced only the performance measure specifically related to that feature of performing the skill. However, on the last two days of practice, KP about *distance caused people to improve all three performance features*. Thus, giving KP about one performance feature led to improvement not only of that one, but also of the two other performance features.
在练习的早期，个体获得的 KP 类型仅影响技能操作中相对应的特征。然而，在后两天的练习中，*关于距离的 KP 使该组被试的上述三个操作特征都有所提高*。因此，关于某一操作特征的 KP 可以带来该特征以及其他两个操作特征的提高。

**Quantitative versus Qualitative Augmented Feedback and the Performance Bandwidth Technique**
**定量与定性追加反馈与表现带宽技术**


Cauraugh, Chen, and Radlo (1993) had subjects practice a timing task in which they had to press a sequence of three keys in 500 msec. Participants in one group received quantitative KR about their movement times (MT) when MT was *outside* a 10 percent performance bandwidth. A second group, in the reverse of that condition, received quantitative KR only when MT was *inside* the 10 percent performance bandwidth. Two additional groups had participants “yoked” to ­individual participants in the outside and inside bandwidth conditions. Members of these two groups ­received KR on the same trials their “yoked” counterparts did. This procedure provided a way to have two conditions with the same frequency of augmented feedback, while allowing a comparison between bandwidth and no-bandwidth conditions.
Cauraugh、Chen 和 Radlo (1993) 让受试者练习时机任务，在 500 毫秒内按压规则排列的三个按键。当运动时间超出标准时间的10%表现带宽时，其中一组被试获得关于运动时间的定量 KR。第二组的练习条件正好相反，只有当表现处于10%表现带宽范围内时，才获得定量 KR。还有另外两组被试分别与前两组被试配对。配对各组的被试在同一次练习中获得 KR 的条件始终保持一致。这一程序可以使组间的追加反馈频率保持一致，这样就可以比较带宽条件和非带宽条件带来的学习差异。

In terms of KR frequency, those in the outside bandwidth condition received quantitative KR on 25 percent of the sixty practice trials; those in the inside condition received KR on 65 percent of the trials. The interesting feature of this difference is that the remaining trials for both groups were implicitly qualitative KR trials, because when they received no KR, the participants knew that their performance was “good” or “not good.” The retention test performance results showed that the two bandwidth conditions did not ­differ, but both yielded better learning than the no-bandwidth conditions. These results show that establishing performance bandwidths as the basis for providing quantitative KR yields an interplay between quantitative and qualitative KR that facilitates skill learning.
根据 KR 频率，超出带宽提供 KR（带宽外）条件组在 60 次练习中的 25%均获得了 KR。不超出带宽提供 KR（带宽内）条件组则在 65%的练习中获得 KR。这一差异的有趣之处在于除了获得 KR 的练习外，在剩下的练习中这两组被试均获得暗含的定性 KR，因为当被试没有获得 KR 时，他们知道自己的表现是“好”还是“坏”。保持测试结果显示，这两种表现带宽条件之间无差异，但是均获得了好于非带宽条件的学习效果。这些结果表明，作为提供定量 KR 的依据，建立表现带宽可以在定量和定性 KR 之间产生相互作用，这将促进技能的学习。

**An Example of Basing Verbal KP on a Skill Analysis**
**在技术分析的基础上建立言语 KP 的示例**

In an experiment by Weeks and Kordus (1998), twelve-year-old boys who had no previous experience in soccer practiced a soccer throw-in. The participants’ goal was to perform throw-ins as accurately as possible to a target on the floor. The distance to the target was 75 percent of each participant’s maximum throwing distance. They received verbal KP on one of eight aspects of technique, which the researchers referred to as “form.” Which aspect of form each ­participant received was based on the primary form problem identified for a throw-in. The researchers constructed a list of eight “form cues” on the basis of a skill analysis of the throw-in and used this list to give verbal KP. The eight form cues were these:
在 Week 和 Kordus (1998) 的实验中，前期无足球经验的 12 岁男孩学习掷边线球。受试者的目标是向地板上的目标尽可能准确地掷边线球。目标的距离是个体最大投掷距离的 75%。在与执行相关的 8 个技术方面，研究者将这些技术方面称为“形态（form）”，受试者获得关于其中一个方面的言语 KP。受试者获得的 KP 内容取决于掷边线球动作中出现的主要形态问题。研究者们在掷边线球技术动作分析的基础上列出了该动作的 8 个“形态线索（form cues）”，并使用这一列表提供言语KP。这 8 个形态线索分别是：

The feet, hips, knees, and shoulders should be aimed at the target, feet shoulder width apart.
脚、臀和肩应该瞄准目标，脚与肩同宽

The back should be arched at the beginning of ­the throw.
在投掷开始前应该弓背。

The grip should look like a “W” with the thumbs together on the back of the ball.
抓握手的大拇指在球后搭成字母“W”状。

The ball should start behind the head at the beginning of the throw.
在投掷开始时，球运动的起始点应该在头后。

The arms should go over the head during the throw and finish by being aimed at the target.
在投掷过程中，手臂运动应该绕过头，并停止于瞄准目标的方向。

There should be no spin on the ball during ­its flight.
在球飞行的过程中应该没有旋转。

The ball should be released in front of the head.
在头前将球脱手。

Feet should remain on the ground.
脚始终不能离地。

**Skilled Athletes Progress through Distinct Stages as They Learn to Use Video Replays**
**高水平运动员学习对录像演示的使用分为不同的阶段**

A study by Hebert, Landin, and Menickelli (1998) investigated the use of video replays as a part of the practice sessions for skilled female tennis players who needed to improve their attacking shots. Although the players who watched the video replays improved more than the players who did not, the athletes required a period of time to learn to use the replays effectively. According to the researchers’ field notes and recordings of the athletes while they watched the videotapes, this period of time involved a progression through four stages in their use of the replays:
Hebert、Landin 和 Menickelli （1998） 的研究探讨了在练习中使用录像演示手段对高水平女网球运动员提高击球技术的作用。尽管观看录像的运动员比没有观看录像的运动员进步幅度更大，但是运动员需要一定的时间来学习如何有效地使用录像演示手段。根据科学研究领域的提示以及对观看录像运动员的记录，录像演示学习时期按进程通常经历以下四个阶段：

Players familiarized themselves with observing themselves on video. They made general ­comments about how they personally looked on video as well as about their playing techniques.
学习者通过观看录像演示熟悉自己，形成对于录像中的自我和技术执行的总体认识。

Players began to recognize specific technical ­errors in their attack shots.
学习者开始辨认出击球动作中的错误。

Players became more analytical as they made ­direct connections between their technique and the outcome of that technique.
学习者能分析出技术动作与动作结果的联系。

Players began to use their observations of replays to indicate corrections they should make to their technique errors. They indicated awareness of the key aspects of their performance that related to successfully hitting the attack shot.

**A Case Study of the Use of Center of Gravity as Augmented Feedback for Balance Training for Stroke Patients**
**中风患者平衡训练中使用重心生物反馈的案例研究**

A form of augmented feedback that has been used for balance training in physical therapy contexts is the visual presentation on a computer monitor of a person’s ­center of gravity. A case study reported by Simmons and associates (1998) is an interesting example of the effectiveness of this type of augmented feedback in a clinical setting.
在物理治疗情境中，用于平衡训练的生物反馈形式是在电脑显示器上以视觉形式呈现个体的重心。Simmons 及其同事（1998）报告的案例研究就探讨了这种生物反馈形式的有效性。

***The patient:*** A seventy-four-year-old poststroke, hemiparetic male with whom therapists were working to help him regain balance control while standing.
***患者：*** 一位 74 岁的中风、轻度偏瘫的男性患者，康复师正在帮助他重新获得站立时的平衡控制。

***Balance training therapy:*** Following a pretest, the patient engaged in three balance training therapy ­sessions a week for four weeks. During each therapy session the patient stood on two force plates while looking at a computer monitor placed at eye level. On the monitor, he could see a small white dot superimposed on a white cross, which indicated an appropriate center of gravity while standing. During each therapy session, a clear plastic template marked with a circular pattern of eight alphabetic letters was placed on the monitor. A verbal command to the patient indicated that he should initiate a weight shift that would cause the white dot to move from the center and hit the target letter and then return the dot back to the center cross. The patient did this for six 1 min intervals with a 45 sec rest between intervals. A posttest followed at the end of the 4 wk training period, and a retention test was given two weeks later.
***平衡训练疗法：*** 在预测试之后，患者一周进行 3 次平衡训练物理治疗，共持续 4 周。在每次平衡训练中，患者双脚站立在两个测力盘上，同时观看与眼平齐的电脑显示器。在电脑显示器上，患者可以看到一个白色十字上的小白点，表示站立时恰当的重心位置。在每次平衡训练中，电脑显示器上放置一个用英文字母标识的圆形排列的塑料模板。语言命令提示患者变换重心使电脑显示器上的白点从白色十字中心移开，击中目标字母，之后将白点返回白色十字中心。患者每次练习持续 1 分钟，每次练习间休息 45 秒。在 4 周物理治疗结束时，进行治疗后测试，在其后两周进行保留测试。

***Results:*** One of the tests simulated a sudden loss of balance, which involved a quick (400 msec) 5.7 cm forward and backward movement of the force plates on which the patient was standing. The patient’s performance on this motor control test during the 2 wk retention test showed a 60 percent improvement for response strength of the affected leg, and a marked shift in balance onto the affected leg in the patient’s attempts to regain balance.
***结果：*** 其中的一个测试模拟突然失去重心，即患者站立的两个力盘上出现快速的（400 毫秒）5.7 厘米的前后运动。在治疗后两周进行的保持测试中，患者在这种运动技能控制测试的表现显示麻痹腿反应力量提高 60%，并且在重新获得平衡的尝试中患者向患腿进行了显著的平衡移动。

**When Reduced Frequency of KR Is Not Beneficial: Learning with Proprioception Deficits**
**对于本体感觉缺陷者，降低 KR 频率没有益处**

Parkinson’s disease (PD) is characterized by basal ganglia dysfunction. As a result, people with PD have a compromised proprioceptive feedback system that often leads to their having difficulty with the timing control of movements and integrating sensory and motor information. Because of this deficit, it would be expected that people with PD would benefit from KR as an external source of performance information to make the types of movement corrections needed ­to learn a motor skill that requires precise timing ­of an arm movement. An experiment reported by ­Guadagnogli, Leis, Van Gemmert, and Stelmach (2002) tested this hypothesis by comparing PD patients with normal age-matched individuals on the ­effect of different frequencies of KR for learning a motor skill.
帕金森病（PD）的特征是基底神经节功能障碍。因此，PD 患者的本体感受反馈系统受损，这通常导致他们在运动的时机控制和整合感觉和运动信息方面有困难。由于这种缺陷，可以预期 PD 患者将受益于 KR 作为表现信息的外部来源：KR 将帮助他们纠正动作错误，这对于学习那些需要精确控制时机的手臂运动是必要的。Guadagnogli、Leis、Van Gemmert 和 Stelmach （2002）报道的一项实验通过比较 PD 患者和同龄健康个体在不同频率的 KR 下学习运动技能的表现来检验这一假设。

***Participants:*** Twenty PD patients (avg. age = 65.2 years); Twenty normal age-matched adults.
***受试者：*** 20位 PD 患者（平均年龄 65.2 岁）； 二十位同龄健康成年个体。 

***Task:*** Make an arm-pointing movement as close as possible to a goal movement time (based on 65 percent of a participant’s maximum speed). The movement began at a home position on a tabletop in front of the participant and moved to a target located ­behind a barrier that required the arm to initially move to the right to avoid the barrier and then to ­the left to the target. The minimum distance possible was 39 cm.
***任务：*** 做一个尽可能接近目标运动时间（基于当前受试者最大速度的65%）的手臂指向动作。动作从受试者前面的桌面上的起始位置开始，并移动到位于障碍物后面的目标，这要求手臂首先向右移动以避开障碍物，然后向左移动到目标。可能的最小距离是39厘米。

***Practice and test:*** Sixty practice trials followed by 10 min of general conversation (i.e., a “filled” ­retention interval) followed by a fifteen-trial no-KR ­retention test.
***练习和测试：*** 60次练习，然后是10分钟的一般对话(即“填充”保持间隔)，接着是15次无 KR 保留测试。

***KR conditions:*** KR was displayed on a computer monitor as the percentage too fast or too slow of the goal movement time (presented on a computer monitor); for example, if goal movement time was 2,000 msec, and movement was 2,400 msec, KR was displayed as “20% too fast.”
***KR条件：*** KR 为相对于目标运动时间过快或过慢的百分比（目标运动时间和百分比都会显示在电脑屏幕上）；比图，如果目标移动时间为 2000 毫秒，实际移动时间为 2400 毫秒，KR 显示为 “快了20%”。

One-half of PD patients and control participants received KR on
PD 患者和对照组受试者各自分为两组，接受 KR 的频率分别为

100 percent of the practice trials
每次练习（100%）后都接受 KR

20 percent of the practice trials
20%的练习后接受 KR

***Results:***
***结果：***

*End of practice:* Absolute error (AE) and variable ­error (VE) scores did not differ between the two KR frequencies, although the PD patients had higher amounts of error than the controls.
*练习结束*：使用两种频率的组的绝对误差（AE）和相对误差（VE）得分没有差异，尽管 PD 患者的错误量高于对照。

*No-KR retention test:* The PD patients with 20 percent KR frequency during practice had higher AE and VE scores than those with 100 percent KR frequency. The control participants with 100 percent KR frequency during practice had higher AE and VE scores than those with 20 percent KR frequency.
*无 KR 保留测试：* 练习时 KR 频率为 20% 的 PD 患者比 KR 频率为 100% 的PD患者有更高的AE和VE评分。练习时使用 100% 频率的对照组受试者比使用 20% KR 频率的参与者有更高的 AE 和 VE 分数。

***Conclusion:*** Consistent with research with healthy adults, KR presented on 100 percent of the practice trials led to poorer learning of the arm movement skill than when KR was presented on only 20 percent of the practice. However, the opposite result was found for the PD patients. As hypothesized, to learn the movement timing skill, the PD patients depended on KR during practice as an external source of ­information to provide movement time feedback that they could not interpret through their own proprioceptive feedback system or integrate with the motor system.
***结论：*** 与前面以健康成年人为对象的研究一致，100% KR 比 20% KR 导致了更差的手臂运动技能学习效果。然而，在 PD 患者中发现了相反的结果。如假设的那样，为了学习这种精确时机技能，PD 患者在练习期间依赖 KR 作为外部信息源以提供运动时间反馈，他们不能通过本体感受反馈系统或运动系统得到这一信息。
