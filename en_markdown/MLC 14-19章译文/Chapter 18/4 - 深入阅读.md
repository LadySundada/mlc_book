Repeat steps 2 and 5.
重复进行第2步和第5步

Between-component timing: critical for performance.
把握各步骤之间的时机对技能至关重要

***Organization characteristics.*** Doing any one part without doing the part that precedes or follows it does not allow the learner to experience critical between-component timing aspects.
**组织性特征**：如果只练习某一个步骤而不练习其前面或后面的步骤，练习者将无法体会到把握各步骤间的时机的重要性。

***Conclusion.*** Three-ball juggling involves several component parts that are highly interdependent. Therefore, juggling three balls is relatively high in complexity and in organization. *Practicing the whole skill* is the predicted appropriate method.
**结论**：同时抛接三球的技能包含了多个高度相互依赖的组成部分。因此，抛接三球的技能的复杂性和组织性都相对较高。预计采用*整体练习*更为合适。

**Empirical Evidence Supporting the Whole-Practice Prediction**
**支持采用整体练习的预测的经验证据**

In an experiment that has become a classic, Knapp and Dixon (1952) told university students who had no previous juggling experience to practice until they could make 100 consecutive catches while juggling three paddle-tennis balls. Results showed that students who followed a whole-practice approach achieved this goal in sixty-five trials, whereas those who followed a part-practice regime needed seventy-seven trials. Because juggling is relatively high in complexity, an important caveat is that whole practice might not be the most effective practice strategy for learners whose information processing capacity is limited. In support of this idea, Chan, Luo, Yan, Cai, and Peng (2015) showed that children’s age determined whether whole or part practice was most effective for learning a juggling task. Fifth graders learned best with whole practice, whereas first and third graders learned best with part practice.
Knapp 和 Dixon（Knapp ＆ Dixon，1952）的经典实验中要求那些先前没有抛接球经验的大学生一直练习直到他们能连续同时抛接三个网球100次。结果表明，采用整体练习法的学生在第65次尝试中就达到了这一目标，而采用分解练习法的学生则需要77次尝试才能实现。但很有必要指出，由于抛接球的复杂性相对较高，因此对于信息处理能力有限的练习者，整体练习法可能并不是最有效的。Chan、Luo、Yan、Cai 和 Peng（Chan、Luo、Yan、Cai＆Peng，2015）的实验支持了这一观点。他们指出，在指导儿童学习抛接球的技能时，哪种练习方式有效取决于儿童的年龄。五年级学生采用整体练习法学习效果最好，而一年级和三年级学生采用分解练习法学习效果最好。

The training of surgeons involves teaching surgical tasks that require practice. Because these tasks vary in their complexity and organization characteristics, decisions concerning the use of whole- or part-practice procedures are essential to teaching surgeons to acquire the skills needed to perform these tasks. Researchers in Toronto, Canada (Dumbrowski, Backstein, Abughaduma, Leidl, & Carnahan, 2005), used this point of view to investigate the procedures used to train medical students to perform the surgical task of bone plating, which involves the immobilizing of a fractured bone by attaching a metal plate to it. The researchers addressed two questions: (1) Is it better to initially practice the bone-plating procedure by performing the whole procedure on each practice attempt or by practicing the individual skills that constitute the procedure? (2) If the answer to the first question is that a part-practice strategy is preferable, then would a blocked or random practice schedule for the individual parts be better for learning?
外科医生在培训过程中需要去学习那些需要练习的外科手术任务。由于这些任务的复杂性和组织性各不相同，因此为了教授外科医生掌握执行这些任务所需的技能，选择使用何种练习方式至关重要。加拿大多伦多的研究人员Dumbrowski、Backstein、Abughaduma、Leidl 和 Carnahan（Dumbrowski、Backstein、Abughaduma、Leidl＆Carnahan，2005）运用这一观点对培训医学生执行植骨手术任务（即在骨折处固定一块金属板）的手术过程进行了研究。研究人员提出了两个问题：（1）刚开始练习植骨手术的时候是在每次练习中执行整个手术过程更好，还是练习手术过程中每个独立的技能更好？（2） 如果第一个问题的答案是分解练习策略更可取，那么对于每个独立部分是采用组块练习还是随机练习更有利于学习？

**The Whole–Part Practice Decision for an Orthopedic Surgical Task**
**骨科手术任务中对于整体-分解练习法的选择**

***The bone-plating surgical task:*** A task analysis by two orthopedic surgeons showed that the task is a serial task in which the parts are distinct, must be performed in a specific order, and are interrelated because each succeeding part depends on the performance of the preceding parts. The task analysis identified five parts: (1) sizing the plate and clamping it to the bone, (2) drilling six holes of precise depth and dimension in the bone, (3) measuring the depth of each drilled hole, (4) creating threading in the bone for the screws (called “bone tapping”), and (5) inserting the screws.
**植骨手术任务**：两位骨科医生的任务分析表明这是一个各个部分均独立不同的序列任务，但是因为每一个后续部分都取决于前一个部分的执行，因此各个部分又相互关联且连续，必须按照一个特定的顺序进行。根据任务分析确定出了五个部分：（1）确定金属板的尺寸，并将它固定在骨头上（2）在骨头上钻六个精确深度和尺寸的孔（3）测量每个钻孔的深度（4）在骨骼中为螺钉切割对应的螺纹（称为“骨攻钉”）（5）插入螺钉。

***Participants and practice procedures:*** Twenty-eight first- and second-year medical students who had no experience in the bone-plating procedure practiced the task on artificial ulna bones. They first watched a video of a surgeon performing the entire procedure and then performed one pretest trial of the entire procedure before they began a 60 min practice period.
**参与者和手术练习过程**：28名没有植骨经验的一年级和二年级的医学生在人造尺骨上练习这项任务。他们首先观看了一个外科医生执行整个手术过程的视频，然后在长约60分钟的练习开始之前对整个手术过程进行了一次预试验。

***Whole- and part-practice conditions:*** The students were assigned to one of three groups, one for each of the practice conditions: (1) *whole practice*—performed all five parts in sequence on each practice trial; (2) *blocked part practice*—practiced one part of the procedure three times in a 12 min session before practicing the next part; (3) *random part practice*—practiced each part of the procedure in random order in three 20 min sessions. Each student practiced each part three times during the practice session and received augmented feedback as needed from an orthopedic surgeon.
**整体和分解练习条件**：将学生随机分为三组，每个小组分别对应一种练习条件：（1）整体练习法，每次练习中依次完成所有五个部分（2）组块分解练习法，练习下一个部分之前，在12分钟内练习这一部分三次（3）随机分解练习法，在三个20分钟的练习环节中，随机练习手术过程中的每个部分。要求每个学生在练习课上将每个部分练习三次，并根据需要从骨科医生那里获得追加反馈。

***Posttests:*** The students performed the entire procedure one time immediately after the end of the 60 min practice session and then one more time 30 min later. They received no augmented feedback during the posttests.
**后测试**：在60分钟的练习课结束后，要求学生们立即执行一次完整手术过程，并于30分钟后再进行一次。在后测试中他们不会收到追加反馈。

***Results:*** Of the several performance measures, a checklist of specific procedures and a final product evaluation (both were determined and evaluated by a panel of three skilled orthopedic surgeons) showed that whole practice led to the most improvement and best final product. Random part practice was next, although not statistically significantly different from whole practice, and blocked practice was third on both performance measures.
**结果**：在几个表现指标中，一份详细手术过程清单和一个最终结果评估（这两项均由三名技术熟练的骨科医生组成的专家组确定和评估）表明采用整体练习法可以获得最大的提高和最好的结果，其次是随机分解练习法。组块分解练习法虽然在统计意义上与整体练习法没有显著差异，但在这两项表现指标中排第三。

***Recommendations for bone-plating surgery training:*** A whole-practice strategy is recommended for the training of the bone-plating surgical procedure. However, if a part-practice strategy is used, the parts should be practiced in a random order, which could be done by having a station for each part and having students randomly rotate through the stations after performing one trial at each station.
**植骨手术培训建议**：推荐采用整体练习策略培训植骨手术。然而如果采用分解练习策略，那么应该随机练习各个部分。可以为每个部分设置一个站点，学生在每个站点执行完一次练习后随机轮换到其他站点进行练习。

**Whole- and Part-Practice Conditions that Facilitate the Learning of Bimanual Coordination Skills**
**促进双手协调技能学习的整体练习条件和分解练习条件**

Bimanual coordination skills that require each arm to simultaneously perform different movements are difficult to learn because of the tendency for the two arms to spatially and temporally move together. Walter and Swinnen (1994) discussed various training approaches that would facilitate learning to break this “habit” for skills that require different simultaneous arm movements. Their research involved a task that required participants to place each forearm on a lever on a tabletop and to move them simultaneously so that one arm made a one-direction elbow-flexion movement and the other made a two-direction elbow-flexion-extension movement in a criterion amount of time. Their research demonstrated that the following three techniques accomplished this learning goal. Note that one involved part-task practice and two involved whole-task practice.
双手协调技能需要两侧手臂同时进行不同的运动，由于两只手臂在空间和时间上倾向于共同运动，因此这类技能的学习难度很大。Walter 和 Swinnen（Walter＆Swinnen，1994）讨论了各种有助于学习打破这种“定势”的技能训练方法，这些技能需要两侧手臂同时进行不同的运动。他们的研究任务要求受试者将前臂放在桌面的手柄上并同时移动两个手柄，在一定时间内一只手臂做单向屈肘运动，另一只手臂做双向肘的屈伸运动。他们的研究证实了下面三种策略可以实现这个学习目标。注意其中一个是分解任务练习法，两个是整体任务练习法。

**Fractionization.** The movement patterns were practiced separately for each arm and then with the two arms moving simultaneously.
**部分化法**：每只手臂先单独练习所需的运动模式，然后两侧手臂同时进行练习。

**Speed-based simplification.** Initial practice of the bimanual task was at a slower speed than the criterion; subsequent sets of trials involved the progressive increase of the speed until the criterion speed was practiced.
**速度简化法**：在练习双手任务的初始阶段以低于标准的速度进行练习；随后的几组测试中逐渐提高练习的速度，直到达到标准速度。

**Augmented feedback.** Practice involved the two arms simultaneously moving and augmented feedback provided after each trial as KP (the acceleration-time traces for each limb) or KR (correlation values indicating the degree of between-arm relationship).
**追加反馈法**：两侧手臂同时进行练习，每次测试后给予受试者KP（每侧肢体的加速度-时间曲线）或KR（表征两侧手臂间协调程度的相关值）作为追加反馈。

*Note:* The ball-juggling score for participants in the beanbag practice group was over 50 percent higher than those for the juggling balls group and the progression group, and over 100 percent higher than that of the group that practiced with weighted scarves and then beanbags before using the balls.
*注意*：使用沙包练习的受试者比使用球练习的受试者在抛接球中从得分高出50%，比那些先用加重的丝巾，之后换成沙包，最后使用球练习的受试者高出100%。

An experiment reported by Hautala (1988) demonstrated that beginning juggling practice by using easier objects is beneficial for learning to juggle three balls.
Hautala （1988）发表的一个实验表明，在练习抛接球的初始阶段使用一些容易操纵的物品有利于学习抛接三球技能。

The participants were boys and girls ten to twelve years old with no previous juggling experience. All of them practiced 5 min per day for fourteen days and then were tested for 1 min with the juggling balls.
受试者为10~12岁没有抛接球经验的男孩和女孩。练习共持续14天，受试者每天进行5分钟的练习，之后进行1分钟的抛接球测试。

**Training Wheels versus Balance Bicycles to Teach Bicycling**
**辅助轮与平衡自行车在自行车教学中的应用**

Training wheels have been used for many years to simplify the task of learning to ride a bicycle. Although training wheels seem to be an excellent example of the *simplification* approach to organizing part practice, one can also see elements of the *fractionization* and *segmentation* approaches in their use because the wheels enable the learner to practice the pedaling, steering, and braking components of the bicycling skill independent of the balance component. As proficiency increases on the other components, the balance component is gradually introduced and made more challenging by adjusting the height of the training wheels above the ground so that the bike can tilt more and more from side to side. 
多年来，人们一直使用辅助轮来简化学习骑自行车的任务。虽然辅助轮似乎是一个使用*简化法*组织分解练习的很好的例子，但是由于辅助轮使得学习者能够不受平衡部分的影响来练习自行车技巧中的踩踏板、转向和制动部分，因此还是可以看到*部分化法*和*分割法*的一些要素。随着其他部分熟练程度的提高，就可以逐渐开始练习平衡部分，并且通过调整辅助轮的离地高度还可以让自行车越来越左右倾斜，使骑行技能更具挑战性。

In recent years, the balance bicycle has become an increasingly popular way to introduce a child to bicycling. The balance bike is simply a bicycle without pedals or brakes. When the bicycle saddle is adjusted so that the child’s feet can touch the ground, he or she can then propel the bike by essentially “walking” with it between the legs and can coast by lifting the feet off the ground. Interestingly, the first bicycle ever invented, by the German Karl von Krais in 1817, was referred to as a “swiftwalker” because it also had no pedals and so was propelled in the same way. In contrast to training wheels, the balance bicycle allows the learner to first practice the balance and steering components of bicycling independently of the pedaling and braking components. 
近年来，通过平衡自行车引导儿童学骑自行车的方法变得越来越流行。平衡自行车是一种没有踏板或刹车的自行车。只要调整自行车座使儿童的脚接触到地面，之后就可以通过把自行车夹在两腿之间“行走”来推动自行车前进，也可以抬起脚在地面滑行。有趣的是，1817年德国人 Karl von Krais 发明的第一辆自行车就被称为“疾走者（swiftwalker）”，因为这辆车没有踏板，前进方式与平衡自行车相同。与辅助轮相比，平衡自行车可以让学习者在不受踩踏板和制动部分影响的情况下先练习骑自行车中的平衡和转向部分。

Balance bicycle advocates argue that it is better to master the balance and steering components before adding the pedaling and braking components. Moreover, they argue that balancing and steering need to be practiced together because countersteering, which prevents the bicycle from tilting to the side, is integral to learning to balance on the bicycle. In other words, balancing and steering are interdependent (highly organized) components in bicycling. Some critics of training wheels have suggested that the wheels prevent the learning of countersteering, particularly if the height of the wheels is adjusted incorrectly, so that when the child rides without training wheels he or she has to unlearn and relearn how to steer. Whether this is true or not needs to be verified independently and whether training wheels or balance bicycles represent the best way to initially teach a child how to ride a bike is an open question at this point in time. Nevertheless, both methods are interesting examples of how part practice is commonly used to teach new skills.
主张使用平衡自行车的人认为在练习踩踏板和制动部分之前，最好先掌握平衡和转向部分。此外，他们认为平衡和转向需要一起练习，因为推把可以防止自行车侧倾，是学习保持自行车平衡的必要条件。一些反对辅助轮的人认为辅助轮阻碍了推把的学习，尤其是在车轮高度调整不当的时候。这样一来当儿童在没有辅助轮的情况下骑行时不得不忘记之前所学并去重新学习如何转向。这些说法是否属实还需要单独进行验证；儿童入门骑自行车的最佳方法是辅助轮还是平衡自行车目前也没有定论。但无论如何，这两种方法都是说明分解练习通常是如何用于学习新技能的有趣例子。

**Virtual Reality Training to Step over Obstacles Improves Walking for Poststroke Hemiplegic Patients**
**利用虚拟现实技术进行跨越障碍的训练以提高脑卒中偏瘫患者的行走能力**

Researchers and physical therapists reported a study in which they compared stepping over real or virtual objects on a treadmill as an intervention strategy for poststroke patients with hemiplegia (Jaffe, Brown, Pierson-Carey, Buckley, & Lew, 2004). The intervention was considered an alternative training technique with a goal of improving walking and decreasing the risk for falls and subsequent injuries.
研究人员和物理治疗师发表了一项对于脑卒中偏瘫患者的干预策略的研究，研究中他们比较了在跑步机上跨越真实障碍物和虚拟障碍物的不同之处（Jaffe, Brown, Pierson-Carey, Buckley, & Lew, 200）。这种干预被认为是一种替代的训练技术，其目的是改善行走能力，降低跌倒和随后受伤的风险。

***Participants:*** 20 adults (8 females, 12 males; mean age = 61.5 yr) who had a stroke more than six months earlier (mean = 3.7 yr poststroke); had a diagnosis of hemiplegia; could walk independently; had an asymmetric gait pattern; and a short step-length (lower than 95th percentile of a normal step-length).
**受试者**：20名成年人（8名女性，12名男性；平均年龄为61.5岁），他们在6个多月前发生了脑卒中（脑卒中平均时长3.7年）；被诊断为偏瘫；能够独立行走；步态不对称；步幅短（低于正常步幅的95%）。

***Training interventions:*** Participants were assigned to either a real or virtual training method. Training for both methods involved stepping over ten stationary objects while walking. Participants wore special “booties” that included contacts and switches for performance analysis purposes and for providing an audio tone to participants when they contacted an object. Each training session included twelve trials, which lasted approximately 1 hr. There were six sessions over a two-week period.
***训练干预***：受试者被随机分为真实障碍物训练组或虚拟障碍物训练组，两种训练方法均要求在步行时跨过10个静止的障碍物。受试者穿着特制的“鞋子”，其中装有用于表现分析的触点和开关，在受试触碰到物体时会向他们提声音信号。在为期两周的训练周期内共有6次训练，每次训练包括12次试验，持续大约1小时。

***Real obstacle training:*** Participants wore a gait-belt and stepped over foam obstacles in a hallway. The obstacles were spaced at intervals of 15–22 in. The obstacles were 2 × 2 in. square and ranged in height and length based on participants’ leg lengths (maximum height = height of inferior border of the patella; maximum length = height of trochanter minus one-half maximum obstacle height).
**真实障碍物训练**：受试者系着步态训练带，跨越过道上的泡沫障碍物。障碍物间隔15-22英寸，为2×2英寸的正方形，高度和长度依据受试者的腿长（最大高度=髌骨下缘高度；最大长度=转子高度减去最大障碍高度的一半）进行调整。

***Virtual obstacle training:*** Participants, who were held in place by an overhead harness, walked at a self-selected speed on a motorized treadmill while holding onto handrails. They wore a head-mounted display that showed real-time images of the same objects used in the real-obstacle training procedure. The display also provided a lateral view of the participants’ legs, which allowed them to observe the position of their feet as they walked, monitor their knee flexion, time their toe-off, and control their stepping height and length.
**虚拟障碍物训练**：用受试者头顶的安全带将其固定，自主选择速度在电动跑步机上行走同时握紧扶手。他们配有的头戴式显示器可以实时显示用于真实障碍训练过程中相同的物体的图像。该显示器还提供了受试者腿部的侧视图像，使得他们可以观察到自己走路时脚的位置，监测膝盖弯曲程度，调整足尖并控制步高和步幅。

***Results:*** Performance was assessed by ten outcome measures related to balance, walking velocity, cadence, stride length, endurance, and obstacle clearance. At two weeks posttraining, both groups showed improved performance compared to their pretest performance, but the virtual-reality-trained participants performed better on six of the ten measures.
**结果**：通过平衡、行走速度、步频、步幅、耐力和障碍排除这10个观测指标来评估表现。在训练两周后，两组的表现相比测试前有所提高，但进行虚拟现实训练的受试者在十项指标中有六项表现更胜一筹。

***Conclusion:***  Virtual reality training can be more effective than real-object training for improving the capability to step over objects as well as various walking characteristics for people with poststroke hemiplegia.
**结论**：对于脑卒中偏瘫患者而言，虚拟现实训练比真实障碍物训练更能有效地提高其跨越物体的能力以及各种行走特征。
