**APPLICATION**
**应用**

An important decision you must make when you teach any motor skill concerns whether it is better to have the learner practice the skill in its entirety or by parts. Consider the following sport skill instruction situation as an example. Suppose you are teaching a beginning tennis class. You are preparing to teach the serve. Most tennis instruction books break down the serve into six or seven parts: the grip, stance, backswing, ball toss, forward swing, ball contact, and follow-through. You must decide whether to have the students practice all of these parts together as a whole or to have them practice each component or group of components separately.
无论教授何种技能，练习组织者都要确定技能练习的方法，即：完整地练习技能从开始到结束的所有部分，还是将技能分成若干个环节或部分后分别进行练习，这对技能学习过程和最终的学习效果起着至关重要的作用。以下面这个运动技能指导情境为例：假设你正在教一门网球入门课，现在打算开始教发球。大多数网球教材都将发球分为六或七个组成部分：握拍、预备姿势、挥拍后摆、抛球、挥拍前摆、触球和跟随动作。你必须决定是让学生将这些部分作为整体一起练习，还是让他们分别练习这几个部分中的一个或几个。

The question of whether to use whole or part practice also confronts professionals in a rehabilitation setting. For example, when a patient needs to learn the task of getting out of bed and getting into a wheelchair, this decision comes into play. Although this task has distinct and identifiable parts, the therapist must determine whether to have the patient practice each part separately or always practice the whole sequence.
在康复情境中，从业人员也面临着是使用整体练习还是分解练习的问题。比如对于下床坐轮椅的任务来说，这项任务由清晰可辨的几个部分组成，因此治疗师必须决定是让病人单独练习每个部分，还是一直练习整个过程。

There are other situations in which the whole–part practice decision must be made. For example, a person may need to learn to perform a skill that requires the asymmetric use of both hands, which is common for playing many musical instruments, such as the piano, guitar, or drums, or performing many activities of daily living, such as opening or closing the lid of a jar. Other skills involve the use of either hand, or foot, but only one at a time, such as dribbling a basketball and kicking a soccer ball. In these skills, proficiency with either hand or foot is important for highly skilled performance.
还有一些其他的情境也要求从业人员做出整体练习或分解练习的决定。比如，练习者可能要学习一项需要不对称地使用双手的技能，这种技能在演奏各种乐器（如钢琴、吉他和鼓）或在完成许多日常活动（如打开或盖上罐子的盖子）时很常见。还有一些技能一次只需要用一只手或一只脚，如运球和踢球。对于这类技能，手脚的熟练程度对于高水平的表现至关重要。

In all the skill learning situations, the practitioner will need to decide whether to begin practice sessions with instruction that engages people in practicing the whole skill or parts of the skill. And if the latter option is chosen, a decision must be made about what kind of part practice. In the following discussion, we will consider these issues in a way that should provide a basis for making these decisions.
在上述所有的技能学习情境中，练习组织者需要在练习周期开始时就决定是指导学习者进行整体练习还是分解练习。如果选择后者，就要决定以何种方式进行分解练习。在接下来的讨论中，我们将讨论上述问题，为做决定提供理论基础。

**DISCUSSION**

The issue of whether to use whole or part practice has been a topic of discussion in the motor learning literature since the early 1900s. Unfortunately, that early research often led to more confusion than understanding. One of the reasons was that researchers tended to investigate the issue in terms of whether one or the other type of practice is better for learning specific skills, without concern for determining skill-related characteristics that could help them make useful generalizations about which practice scheme would be preferable for certain skills. For example, the question of whole versus part practice was investigated for learning a maze task (Barton, 1921) or a piano score (Brown, 1928) as well as for learning how to juggle (Knapp & Dixon, 1952) and master gymnastic skills (Wickstrom, 1958), to name a few examples. Although this research provided useful information about teaching these specific skills, it did little to establish a guiding principle for decisions about whether to use whole or part practice.
自20世纪初，运动学习研究中就涉及了整体练习法和分解练习法的讨论。令人遗憾的是，早期的研究大多没有增进我们对这一问题的理解，反而带了更多的困惑。造成这一现象的一个原因是，研究人员倾向于研究各种练习方式对专项技能的学习的影响，而不是去考虑对具有共同特征的一类技能的影响。然而，恰恰是对技能特征的研究才有助于研究人员将在专项技能上得到的结论推广到更多的技能上。例如，研究人员曾经在完成迷宫任务（Barton, 1921）、弹奏钢琴乐谱（Brown, 1928）、学习抛接球（Knapp & Dixon, 1952）以及掌握体操技巧（Wickstrom, 1958）等情境中研究了整体练习与分解练习的问题。尽管这些研究为专项技能的学习提供了有用的参考，但它们对构建具有指导意义的整体与分解练习法的使用原则没有任何帮助。

**SKILL COMPLEXITY AND ORGANIZATION**
**技能复杂性与技能组织性**

A breakthrough in a guiding principle for the use of whole versus part practice occurred in the early 1960s, when James Naylor and George Briggs (1963) hypothesized that the *organization and complexity characteristics of a skill could provide the basis for a decision to use either whole or part practice.* This hypothesis made it possible for practitioners to determine for any skill which of these two methods of practice would be preferable.
在建立指导性原则方面，20世纪60年代早期出现了一个研究突破。James Naylor 和 George Briggs（1963）在当时提出了如下假说，即*可以根据技能的复杂性与组织性特征决定是使用整体练习还是分解练习*。这一假说使得练习组织者得以判断在各种技能的学习中，整体练习法和分解练习法究竟哪种更为适用。

Naylor and Briggs defined **complexity** in a way that is consistent with the term’s use in this text. They stated that *complexity* refers to the number of parts or components in a skill, as well as the attention demands of the task. This means that *a highly complex skill would have many components and demand much attention,* especially from a beginner. Performing a dance routine, serving a tennis ball, and getting out of bed and into a wheelchair are examples of highly complex skills. Low-complexity skills have few component parts and demand relatively limited attention. For example, the skills of shooting an arrow and picking up a cup are low in complexity. *It is important to keep the term complexity distinct from difficulty.* As you saw in the discussion of Fitts’ law in chapter 7, skills of the same complexity can vary in their level of difficulty.
Naylor 和 Briggs 当时对术语**复杂性**的定义与本教材中的用法一致。他们认为，*复杂性*指的是一项技能的组成部分的数量，以及任务对注意力的需求。也就是说，*高复杂性的技能会由许多部分组成，同时对注意力也有更高的要求*，尤其是对初学者来说。表演舞蹈，网球发球以及下床坐轮椅都是典型的高复杂性技能。而低复杂性技能的组成部分通常较少，而且对注意力的需求也相对有限，像射箭和拿杯子的复杂性就比较低。*值得注意的是复杂性与难度并不相同。* 在第7章对菲兹定律的讨论中就已经看到，复杂性相同的技能在难度上可能有所不同。

The **organization** of a skill refers to the relationships among the component parts of a skill. A skill has a *high level of organization* when its component parts are spatially and temporally interdependent. This means that the successive parts of a highly organized skill are like a chain of events in which the spatial-temporal performance characteristics of any one part are dependent on the spatial-temporal performance characteristics of the part performed just before it. Because of this characteristic, it would be difficult to perform only one part of a highly organized skill. The jump shot in basketball is a good example of a highly organized skill, because how a person performs each part will depend on the manner in which he or she performed the part(s) that preceded it. Although the arm and hand movements involved in the release of the ball could be practiced separately, the spatial location of the arm and hands as well as the timing of the ball release must be related to other parts of the skill, such as the direction and the height of the jump. In contrast, a skill has a *low level of organization* when the spatial-temporal relationships among the component parts of a skill are relatively independent. As a result, it is possible to practice any one component part by itself, because its spatial-temporal performance characteristics do not depend on those of the part that precedes it. Examples here include many gymnastics floor routines, buttoning a shirt, and handwriting certain words.
技能的**组织性**指的是技能组成部分之间的关系。如果一项技能的组成部分在空间和时间上相互依赖，就说这项技能的*有较高的组织性水平*。也就是说，高组织性的技能就像一个连续的事件链条，链条上任何一个部分的时空表现特征都和前一个部分的时空表现特征相关。正是由于这个特点，练习者很难单独执行高组织性技能的单个部分。篮球中的跳投就是一种典型的高组织性技能，因为该技能每个部分的完成方式都取决于前一部分的完成方式。尽管出手时的手臂和手部动作都可以单独练习，但手臂和手在空中的位置以及出手时机却和整个技能的其他部分如起跳的方向和高度联系在一起。相反，如果一项技能的组成部分在空间和时间上相对独立时，就说这项技能的*有较低的组织性水平*。正因如此，练习者可以单独练习技能的任何一个组成部分，因为该部分的时空表现特征不依赖于之前的部分。像体操中的地板动作，扣衬衫扣子和手写单词就是这类技能的典型例子。

**Skill Characteristics and the Decision to Use Whole or Part Practice**
**技能特征与整体练习/分解练习的选择**

Based on the Naylor and Briggs hypothesis, assessing the levels of complexity and organization of a skill helps the practitioner decide whether to use whole or part practice. If the skill is *low in complexity and high in organization,* practice of the whole skill is the better choice. This means that people learn relatively simple skills in which the few component parts are highly related most efficiently using the whole-practice method. For example, the skills of buttoning a button, throwing a dart, and putting a golf ball have the characteristic of low complexity and high organization. On the other hand, people learn skills that are *high in complexity and low in organization* most efficiently by the part method. For example, the skills of executing a tumbling routine in gymnastics; reaching for, grasping, and drinking from a cup; and changing a flat tire on a car have the high complexity and low organization characteristic.
基于 Naylor 和 Briggs 的假说，评估技能的复杂性和组织性有助于练习组织者决定是使用整体练习还是分解练习。对于*复杂性低而组织性高*的技能，整体练习会是更好的选择。也就是说对于相对简单且各组成部分之间高度关联的技能，如扣扣子、掷飞镖和击打高尔夫球，使用整体练习法效率最高。另一方面，对于*复杂性高而组织性低*的技能，分解练习效果更好。像体操中的翻滚动作、伸手拿茶杯以及更换汽车上的爆胎等技能都具有这一特点。

To determine which complexity and organization combinations describe a particular skill, it is necessary to first analyze the skill. This analysis needs to focus on identifying the skill’s component parts and the extent to which the spatial-temporal performance characteristics of those parts are interdependent. On the basis of this analysis you can then decide which levels of skill complexity and organization best represents the skill.
为了确定某个特定技能的复杂性和组织性，首先需要分析这个技能，包括识别出该技能的各个组成部分以及这些组成部分的时空表现特征相互依赖的程度。在此分析的基础上，就可以确定哪种水平的复杂性和组织性最能代表该技能。 

By far, most of the motor skills we perform as a part of our daily living activities and sports would be characterized as more complex than simple. This means that for most skills, the practitioner must determine the level of organization that characterizes the skill. For skills that we would place somewhere between the extremes of low and high on the organization continuum, an additional task analysis step is required. Then, it is necessary to determine which component parts are independent of the others and which group together as interdependent. The result of this analysis will determine which parts could be practiced independently. That is, some of the “parts” a person practices would consist of more than one of the component parts that resulted from the initial task analysis. This grouping of parts can be thought of as a “natural unit” within the skill. Because teachers, coaches, and therapists typically work with motor skills that would suggest some sort of part practice, we will first consider issues relevant to part practice.
目前，日常生活以及运动中的大部分技能的复杂性都相对较高而不是较低。所以，对于大部分技能来说，练习组织者尤其要确定该技能的组织性水平。除去那些组织性极高或极低的技能，大部分组织性介于二者之间的技能都需要进行一步额外的任务分析，然后确定哪些组成部分相互独立，哪些组成部分相互依赖，这一分析的结果将用来决定哪些部分可以单独练习。也就是说，练习者单独练习的某些“部分”可能包含不止一个由一开始的任务分析产生的组成部分，这种“部分”可以被视为是技能中的“自然单元”。考虑到教师、教练和治疗师工作中遇到的运动技能或多或少都需要进行一些分解练习，我们将首先讨论和分解练习有关的问题。

***Continuous, discrete, and serial skills.*** Some researchers have used the skill classification system in which skills are classified as continuous, discrete, or serial, which we discussed in chapter 1, as a way to consider the complexity and organization characteristics of a motor skill. Continuous and serial skills would be generally high in complexity but would differ in their levels of organization, although most would have a high level of organization because of the spatial-temporal relationships among the parts of these skills. Discrete skills are low in complexity because they consist of one identifiable part, which would put them at the high end of the organization continuum. Researchers who have investigated the whole–part practice issue on the basis of these skill classification categories have reported results that are generally consistent with the predictions described in the previous section for the relationship between the complexity-organization characteristics of a skill and whether the skill should be practiced as a whole or in parts (for a review of this research, see Lee, Chamberlin, & Hodges, 2001).
***连续技能、离散技能与序列技能*** 一些研究人员使用了在第一章中讨论过的技能分类系统以确定运动技能的复杂性和组织性。在其中技能被分类为连续技能、离散技能与序列技能。连续技能和系列技能的复杂性通常较高，但组织性各异，不过由于这些技能各部分之间的时空关系，大多数技能的组织性水平较高。另一方面，由于离散技能由一个清晰可辨的部分组成，因此复杂性很低，而组织性则处于较高水平。上一节中我们对技能的复杂性-组织性特征与技能适合的练习方式（整体练习/分解练习）之间的关系进行了预测。而以这种技能分类为基础研究整体练习与分解练习问题的研究人员报告的结果基本上与上一节中的预测一致（关于这一研究的综述，可参见 Lee, Chamberlin, & Hodges, 2001）。

**PRACTICING PARTS OF A SKILL**


The decision to use a part-practice strategy unfortunately solves only part of the problem, because there are several different ways to implement a part-practice approach to the practice of a skill. When selecting a part-practice strategy, it is important to apply transfer of learning principles, which we discussed in chapter 13. Part-practice strategies should involve positive transfer between and among the practiced parts of a task and between the practiced parts and the whole task.
在确定使用分解练习策略后，问题依然没有完全解决，因为有几种不同的方式来实施分解练习。在选择分解练习策略时，应该应用第13章中讨论过的学习迁移原理，分解练习策略应当要在练习的各部分之间以及练习的各部分和整个技能之间产生正迁移。

In their important review of the research literature related to skill training methods, Wightman and Lintern (1985) classified three commonly used part-task strategies. One, called **fractionization,** involves practicing individual limbs first for a skill that involves the asymmetric and simultaneous coordination of the arms or legs. A second method, called **segmentation,** involves separating the skill into parts and then practicing the parts so that after the learner practices one part, he or she then practices that part together with the next part, and so on. Researchers also have called this method the *progressive part method* and the chaining method. A third method of part practice is called **simplification.** This method is actually a variation of a whole-practice strategy but involves reducing the difficulty of the whole skill or of different parts of the skill.
在 Wightman 和 Lintern 对与技能训练方法相关的研究文献的一份综述中，他们对三种常用的分解任务策略进行了分类。第一种方法称为**部分化（fractionization）**[!!“偏侧化”会不会更好一点？]，这种方法要求在练习不对称的肢体协调技能时，先进行一侧肢体的练习。第二种方法称为**分割法（segmentation）**，这一方法要求先将技能分成若干个部分，然后以这种方式进行分解练习：在练习完一个部分后，再把这个部分和下一个部分放到一起进行练习，以此类推。研究人员也称这种方法为*循序渐进法（progressive part method）* 或链式法（chaining method）。分解练习的第三种方法称为**简化法（simplification）**。这种方法实际上是整体练习法一种的变体，只是会降低整个技能或技能不同部分的难度。

**Fractionization: Practicing Asymmetric Limb Coordination Skills**
**部分化法：练习不对称的肢体协调技能**

Many of the motor skills discussed throughout this text require people to simultaneously move their arms or legs to achieve a specific spatial and/or temporal goal. Recall from the discussion of coordination in chapter 5 that the coordination tendency is for the arms or legs to move spatially and temporally together. What this means in terms of part versus whole practice is that because of this coordination tendency, a skill that requires symmetric spatial-temporal coordination of the arms (e.g., the butterfly and breaststroke in swimming) or legs (e.g., the flutter kick for a crawl stroke in swimming or the leg movements for cross-country skiing) would be high in organization. As a result, a whole-practice approach would be preferable. However, when the task requires the two arms or legs simultaneously to do *different* spatial and/or temporal movements (i.e., asymmetric coordination), the question of the use of a part-practice strategy becomes more of an issue.
在本书中讨论过的许多运动技能都要求练习者通过同时移动他们的双臂或双腿来实现特定的空间和（或）时间目标。在第5章对协调性的讨论中提到，手臂或腿部有一种协调同步的倾向，这里的同步是指在空间和时间上均达到同步。这对选择整体练习或分解练习的启示是，由于协调倾向，需要手臂或腿部对称运动且时空协调的技能（如蝶泳和蛙泳中的手臂运动、爬泳和越野滑雪中的腿部运动）往往都具有较高的组织性，因此整体练习法更为可取。然而，一些技能需要用双臂或双腿同时去完成在时间或空间上*有差异*的动作，对于这些技能，将需要更多地分解练习法。

Because asymmetric coordination of the arms is more characteristic of motor skills than asymmetric coordination of the legs, we will address skills in this section that we referred to in chapter 7 as asymmetric bimanual coordination skills. Consider, for example, the simultaneous arm movements involved in the playing of many musical instruments, such as the guitar, violin, and accordion. Each requires the person to simultaneously produce distinctly different movement patterns with each arm and hand. Other instruments, such as the piano and drums, may require this type of movement characteristic but also include simultaneous asymmetric movement of the legs. Sport skills such as the sidestroke in swimming and the tennis serve also involve this type of bimanual coordination. Is a part-practice strategy the best approach for learning these types of skills, or would a whole-practice approach be preferable? Some controversy exists among researchers, and there is evidence to support either approach (see Walter & Swinnen, 1994). If a part-practice approach is used, the most appropriate strategy is *fractionization.*
鉴于在运动技能中双臂的不对称协调比双腿的不对称协调更典型，因此本节主要考虑双臂的不对称协调技能，这种技能在第7章称为不对称双手协调技能。比如，许多乐器的演奏都需要不对称的双手协调动作，比如吉他、小提琴和手风琴等，演奏这些乐器需要演奏者的双臂同时进行形式截然不同的运动。还有一些乐器，如钢琴和鼓，在演奏时不仅需要不对称的双手协调动作，还可能需要不对称的双腿协调动作。像侧泳和网球发球等运动也需要这种双手协调。那么，对于这类技能，分解练习法与整体练习法究竟哪种能带来最佳的学习效果？这以问题在研究人员中一直存在争议，两种观点都有证据支持（见 Walter & Swinnen, 1994）。如果要采用分解练习法的话，最合适的策略是*部分化*。

For asymmetric bimanual skills, the fractionization strategy involves practicing each arm or hand individually before performing the skill bi-manually. A relevant question related to the use of this strategy is this: Does it matter which arm or hand practices first? A feature of asymmetric bimanual coordination skills that is important to consider in answering this question is that one arm or hand will sometimes perform a movement, or sequence of movements, that is more difficult or complex than the other. parts. Research evidence (e.g., Sherwood, 1994) suggests that practice should begin with the hand or arm that must perform the more difficult or complex movement.
对于不对称双手技能，部分化策略要求练习者在用双侧肢体执行技能前先分别练习用单侧肢体执行技能。与使用这种策略相关的一个问题是：先用哪只手臂或手练习重要吗？要回答这个问题，非对称双手协调技能的一个特点十分关键，就是某一侧肢体执行的动作有时会比另一侧肢体执行的更困难、更复杂。研究证据（例如，Sherwood, 1994）表明，练习应该从执行更困难或更复杂动作的那一侧手臂或手开始。

An interesting exception to strict use of practicing each limb separately before performing the skill bimanually was an experiment by Kurtz and Lee (2003) in which participants learned an asymmetric bimanual polyrhythm task. The task simulates a situation that occurs in the playing of musical instruments when one hand plays one rhythmic pattern while the other plays a different pattern, which is not uncommon for playing the piano or drums. Participants practiced a 2:3 polyrhythm for time cycles of 1.8 sec (i.e., 1,800 msec). To perform the polyrhythm correctly, the left hand taps two beats of equal time intervals (i.e., one every 900 msec) while the right hand tapped three beats of equal intervals (i.e., one every 600 msec). This means that the right hand made one tap 600 msec after the beginning of a cycle, then the left hand made one tap 300 msec later (i.e., 900 msec from the beginning), 300 msec later the right hand made its second tap, and 600 msec later, both hands made their final tap simultaneously. 
Kurtz 和 Lee （2003）报告了一个引人注意的例外，表明严格遵照在用双侧肢体执行技能前先分别练习用单侧肢体执行技能的方法不一定是最合适的。在他们的实验中，受试者要完成一个不对称双手复合节奏任务，该任务模拟的是乐器演奏中出现的一种情况，即用一只手演奏一种节奏模式，而另一只手演奏另一种节奏模式，这种情况在演奏钢琴或鼓时并不少见。受试者练习的是循环周期为1.8秒（即1800毫秒）的2:3复合节奏，该节奏要求受试者在一个循环内，左手敲击两个等间隔的拍子（即每900毫秒敲一次），右手敲击三个等间隔的的拍子（即每600毫秒敲一次）。也就是说在循环开始后的600毫秒，左手先敲出第一拍，然后再过300毫秒（即循环开始后的900毫秒），右手敲出第一拍，再300毫秒后右手敲出第二拍，再过600毫秒后，左手和右手一起敲出最后一拍。

Practice involved tapping according to a metronome sound. A part-practice group practiced each hand separately; a whole-practice group practiced both hands together every trial, and a part–whole practice group practiced each hand separately while listening to a metronome beat for both hands. Thus, unlike any of the experiments discussed earlier, in which participants practiced an asymmetric bimanual skill, the Kurtz and Lee experiment included a practice condition that involved unimanual part practice but with participants listening to the same rhythmic pattern which the whole-practice group practiced. Results, which can be seen in figure 18.1, showed that whole and part–whole practice conditions led to the best transfer performance of the bimanual polyrhythm, which was without a metronome. Although these results differ from those of the typical fractionization type of practice, the discrete polyrhythmic characteristic of the skill may account for the difference. However, it is important to note that consistent with the fractionization practice strategy, the part–whole practice strategy used in the Kurtz and Lee experiment involved unimanual practice. The unique characteristic was that their unimanual practice included simultaneously hearing the rhythmic pattern of the bimanual task.
该任务的练习方式是让受试者根据节拍器的声音打拍子。受试者被分为三个练习组：分解练习组单独练习每只手；整体练习组同时练习两只手；分解-整体练习组听完整的节拍，但一次只练习一只手。因此，Kurtz 和 Lee 的练习条件与前面讨论过的都不一样，他们设计了一个新的练习条件，这个条件虽然也是单手分解练习，但练习者听的却是和整体练习组一样的节奏。该实验结果如图18.1所示，表明整体练习和分解-整体练习都可以达成最佳的迁移表现，让受试者在没有节拍器的情况下完成复合节奏任务。虽然该实验结果不同于典型的分解练习，但产生这种差异的原因可能是该任务所具有的离散和复合节奏的特征。而且有必要一提的是，这一实验结果和部分化练习策略其实是一致的，因为 Kurtz 和 Lee 使用的分解-整体练习策略也是单手练习，唯一特殊的是他们的单手练习让练习者同步去听双手任务的节奏。

**Segmentation: The Progressive Part Method**
**分割法：循序渐进练习法**

Although practicing individual parts can be helpful in learning a skill, the learner can experience difficulty later, when he or she has to put the parts back together with the whole skill. One way to overcome this problem is to use the *progressive part method.* Rather than practicing all parts separately before putting them together as a whole skill, the learner practices the first part as an independent unit, then practices the second part—first separately, and then together with the first part. In this way, each independent part progressively joins a larger part. As practice continues, the learner eventually practices the entire skill as a whole.
虽然练习技能中的单个部分有利于技能的学习，但当练习者要将这些部分结合成整个技能的时候就会遇到困难。解决这一问题的一种方法就是采用*循序渐进法*。相比于在练习整个技能前分别练习各个部分的分解练习法，这种方法要求练习者首先将第一部分作为一个单独的单元来练习，然后再练习第二部分——首先单独练习，然后与第一部分一起练习。以这种方式，每个独立的部分逐渐汇整为一个更大的部分，而且随着练习的进行，练习者最终将会把整个技能作为一个完整的部分练习。

A common example of the progressive part method is a frequently used practice scheme for learning the breaststroke in swimming. The breast-stroke is easily subdivided into two relatively independent parts, the leg kick and the arm action. Because a difficult aspect of learning the breast-stroke is the timing of the coordination of these two parts, it is helpful for the learner to reduce the attention demands of the whole skill by practicing each part independently first. This enables the student to direct most of his or her attention to only the limb action requirements, because he or she can learn each part without attending to how to coordinate the two parts as a unit. After practicing each part independently, the swimmer can put them together to practice them as a whole unit, with his or her attention now directed toward both the temporal and spatial coordination demands of the arm and leg actions.
循序渐进法的一个常见例子是学习蛙泳时常用的练习方案。蛙泳很容易被分为两个相对独立的部分，即腿部打水动作和手臂动作。因为学习蛙泳的一个难点是协调这两个部分的执行时机，所以让学习者首先独立练习每个部分有助于降低整个技能的注意力需求，这使得学生能够将他的大部分注意力只集中在肢体动作要求上，因为他可以单独学习每个部分而不需要注意如何将两个部分作为一个整体来协调执行。在独立练习完每个部分后，学习者可以将它们放在一起作为一个整体进行练习，这时他的注意力就要集中在手臂和腿部动作的时间和空间协调配合上。

Skills that involve learning movement sequences lend themselves particularly well to the progressive part method. Researchers have demonstrated this for both laboratory and real-world skills. For example, Watters (1992) reported that the progressive part method was beneficial for learning to type an eight-key sequence on a computer keyboard. And Ash and Holding (1990) found that people learning a musical score on a piano benefited from a progressive part-practice approach. In this experiment, participants learned a musical score of twenty-four quarter notes, grouped into three sets of eight notes each. The first two sets were easy and the third set was difficult. Two types of the progressive part method were better than the whole method for learning to perform this musical score, for which performance was based on errors made, rhythmic accuracy, and rhythmic consistency. Of the two progressive part methods, the one that prescribed an easy-to-difficult progression tended to be better than the one stipulating a difficult-to-easy progression.
涉及学习动作序列的技能特别适合循序渐进法。研究人员已经在实验室和现实世界中证明了这一点。例如，Watters （1992）报告说，循序渐进法有利于学习在计算机键盘上键入一个八键序列的任务。Ash 和 Holding （1990）发现，循序渐进法也有利于在钢琴上学习演奏乐谱的学习者。在这项实验中，受试者学习了由24个四分音符组成的乐谱，这些音符被分成三组，每组八个，前两组很容易，而第三组难度较大。在基于演奏错误、节奏准确性和节奏一致性的表现评价中，两种循序渐进法的学习效果都比整体练习法要好。而在那两种循序渐进法中，由易到难渐进的方法往往比由难到易渐进的方法更好。 

A key characteristic of the progressive part method is that it *takes advantage of the benefits of both part and whole methods of practice.* The part method offers the advantage of reducing the attention demands of performing the whole skill, so that the person can focus attention on specific aspects of a part of the skill. The whole method, on the other hand, has the advantage of practicing together the important spatial and temporal coordination of the parts. The progressive part method combines both of these qualities. Thus, the attention demands of performing the skill are under control, while the parts are put together progressively so that the learner can practice important spatial and temporal coordination requirements of performing the parts as a whole.
渐进部分法的一个关键特点是它兼具*分解练习法和整体练习法的优点*。分解练习法的优点是减少了执行整个技能的注意力需求，因此练习者可以将注意力集中在技能某一部分的特定方面；而整体练习法的优点是可以练习各部分的空间和时间协调。循序渐进法结合了这两种长处，因此，执行技能的注意力需求得到了控制，同时各部分被逐步汇整在一起，这样学习者可以练习到把各部分作为一个整体执行时需要的空间和时间上的协调配合。

**Simplification: Reducing Task Difficulty**
**简化法：降低任务难度**

For a complex skill, simplification is a method that makes either the whole skill or certain parts of the skill less difficult for people to perform. There are several ways to implement a simplification approach to skill practice. We will discuss six of these here. Each is specific to learning a certain type of skill. All of them involve practicing the whole skill, but simplify certain parts of the skill in various ways.
对于复杂技能，简化法可以用来降低整个技能或技能中某些部分的执行难度。要在技能练习中实施简化法，可以使用几种不同的策略，我们在这里只讨论其中六种，每种策略都适合一种特定类型技能的学习。这些策略虽然都包括了对完整技能的练习，但都以各种不同的方式简化了技能的某些部分。


***Reducing object difficulty.*** When a person is learning an object manipulation skill, one way to simplify learning the skill is to *reduce the difficulty of the objects.* For example, someone learning to juggle three balls can practice with bean bags. This reduces the difficulty of the task by involving objects that are slightly larger and easier to catch because they also conform to the shape of the hand. Because these objects are larger and deformable the person does not have to be as precise in positioning the hand to catch the object at the right moment. However, the person still must follow the principles of juggling while learning to juggle the easier objects. We would expect early practice using easier objects to enable the person to learn these juggling principles, and then easily transfer them to juggling with more difficult objects. In fact, research evidence supports this approach to learning to juggle three balls (Hautala, 1988).
***降低操纵物难度*** 如果要学习的是一种有操纵物的技能，可以通过*降低操纵物难度*以简化技能的学习，比如，要学习同时抛接三球的学习者可以用沙包进行练习。这一改变降低了任务难度，因为操纵物变得大了一些，而且由于沙包更符合手的形状，练习者与更容易接住。这样，练习者就不用把手的位置摆得特别精确才能在合适的时刻接住操纵物。但是，练习者在学习抛接球的时候还是必须遵循抛接球的原则。我们希望在早期使用简单的物体让学习者学会抛接球的原则，然后轻而易举地迁移到抛接更复杂的物体的情境。实际上，确实有研究支持用这种方法学习抛接三球的技能（Hautala, 1988）。

***Reducing attention demands.*** Another way to reduce task difficulty is to *reduce the attention demands of the skill without changing the action goal.* This strategy reduces task difficulty by reducing task complexity. One approach to implementing this strategy is to provide physical assistance devices that allow the person to practice the goal of the skill but at the same time reduce the attention demands of the task. For example, Wulf and her colleagues (Wulf, Shea, & Whitacre, 1998; Wulf & Toole, 1999) found that people who used ski poles while they practiced the slalom ski simulator task learned to perform the task without ski poles better than people who practiced without ski poles. The poles allowed the performers to focus more attention on the movement coordination demands of the task. This was possible because of the reduced attention demands for the dynamic balancing component of the task, which resulted from the poles enabling better body stability. It is also notable that in these experiments, transfer from performing with poles to doing so without the poles led to no appreciable reduction in performance level.
***减少注意力需求*** 降低任务难度的另一种方法是*在不改变动作目标的情况下降低技能的注意力需求*，这一策略通过降低任务复杂性来降低任务难度。实施这一策略的一种方法是使用物理辅助设备，这种设备可以降低完成任务目标的注意力需求。例如，Wulf 和她的同事（Wulf, Shea, & Whitacre, 1998; Wulf & Toole, 1999）发现，在练习障碍滑雪模拟器任务时，使用滑雪杖的练习者比不使用滑雪杖的练习者的学习效果要好，而滑雪杖可以帮助执行者将更多的注意力集中在任务的动作协调配合上。之所以会出现这种现象，是因为滑雪杖提高了练习者的身体稳定性，因此减少了任务的动态平衡部分的注意力需求。值得说明的是，在这些实验中，从使用滑雪杖到不使用滑雪杖的迁移并没有导致表现水平的明显降低。

Physical therapy researchers have reported a method for the rehabilitation of gait that reduces the attention demands of gait while maintaining requisite gait movements. The method involves the use of a *body-weight support (BWS) system,* which is a device that controls the amount of body weight a person needs to support while ambulating either on a treadmill or over ground. As shown in figure 18.2, the patient is placed in a harness device that is attached to pulley systems that lift the patient so that the patient is supporting only a specified amount of his or her own body weight. The BWS reduces the attention demand of gait by providing external control of the patient’s posture and balance. 
物理治疗领域的研究人员还报道了一种步态康复方法，该方法在保持必要的步态训练动作的同时降低了步态训练的注意力需求。该方法使用了一种称为“体重支撑（BWS）系统”的装置，这种装置可以控制使用者在跑步机上或地面上行走时需要支撑的体重。如图18.2所示，患者被放置在一个连接到滑轮系统的吊带装置中，滑轮系统会提升患者，使患者仅需要支撑一部分的自身重量。BWS 提供了对患者姿势和平衡的外部控制，进而减少了步态训练的注意力需求。 

An example of the use and effectiveness of the BWS for gait rehabilitation is a case study of two elderly women who continued to experience chronic gait disabilities as a result of a stroke more than two years earlier (Miller, Quinn, & Seddon, 2002). The BWS was used to systematically increase the amount of body weight controlled by the participants themselves for three sessions a week for six to seven weeks of gait training. During each session, the participants used the BWS for walking on a treadmill and overground. At the beginning of training, the BWS controlled 40 percent of the participants’ body weight for each of three 5 min bouts of walking. Over the course of the training, the amount of body weight controlled was reduced to 20 percent and then to 0 percent. In addition, various treadmill speeds were included in the training sessions. Results showed that both women improved their overground walking in terms of technique and endurance. (To read a brief review of research involving BWS training and an experiment in which the system is successfully used with nonambulatory stroke patients, see Yagura, Hatakenaka, & Miyai, 2006.)
佐证BWS在步态康复上的可用性和有效性的一个例子是对两名老年妇女的案例研究，她们由于两年多前的一次中风而患上了慢性步态障碍（Miller, Quinn, & Seddon, 2002）。在每周三次、持续六或七周的的步态训练疗程中，BWS用于系统性地增加参与者自己支撑的体重。在每次训练中，参与者都会使用BWS在跑步机上和地面上行走。在训练开始时，在共计三次、每次持续5分钟的行走训练中，BWS会支撑参与者体重的40%。随着训练的进行，BWS支撑的体重量减少到20%，然后再减少到0%。此外，训练过程中的跑步机速度也有所变化。结果显示，两位女性的地面行走能力在技术和耐力方面都得到了提高。（Yagura, Hatakenaka, & Miyai, 2006 中对BWS训练的研究进行了简要回顾，同时包含了一个将该系统成功用于需要卧床的中风患者的实验）[!!nonambulatory stroke 这个用法比较罕见，查不到什么可靠的解释，只能用词根结合上下文作出这个翻译：non- 不 ambul-走动]

***Reducing speed.*** A third simplification method is useful for the learning of complex skills requiring both speed and accuracy. *Reducing the speed* at which a learner first practices a skill can simplify practice. This approach places emphasis on the relative-time relationships among the skill components and on the spatial characteristics of performing the whole skill. Because a characteristic such as relative time is an invariant feature of a well-established coordination pattern and because people can readily vary overall speed, we would expect that a person could learn a relative-time pattern at a variety of overall speeds. By practicing at a slower speed, the learner would establish the essential relative-time characteristics of a coordination pattern. A commonly used teaching strategy by dance teachers for teaching a new type of dance (e.g., waltz) to beginners is to have them practice the sequence of steps at a slow speed and then increase the speed as they acquire the correct movement pattern of steps.
***降低速度*** 第三种简化策略对于既需要速度又需要准确性的复杂技能的学习非常有用。在练习者首次练习时*降低速度*可以起到简化练习的作用。这种方法的强调的重点是技能组成部分之间的相对时间关系以及完成整个技能的空间特征。因为像相对时间关系这样的特征是固定的协调模式中的不变特征，而且练习者可以很容易地改变整体速度，因此练习者应该可以在各种不同的整体速度下学习相对时间模式。通过慢速练习，学习者将建立基本的协调模式的相对时间特征。舞蹈教师向初学者教授一种新的舞蹈（如华尔兹）时，常用的教学策略是让他们以较慢的速度练习一系列舞步，然后随着他们习得正确的舞步运动模式而加快速度。 

It is interesting to note that the training strategy of reducing the speed of a task also benefits the learning of asymmetric bimanual coordination tasks in which each arm performs different spatial-temporal patterns but with the same overall duration of time. What makes this interesting is that in the earlier discussion about the fractionization training strategy, that strategy also facilitated the learning of this type of bimanual task.
引入注意的是，降低任务速度的训练策略也有利于学习非对称双手协调任务，在这些任务中每只手臂要执行不同的时空运动模式，但总持续时间相同。有趣的是，之前讨论的部分化训练策略也可以促进这类双手任务的学习。 

Evidence for the beneficial effects of the speed-reduction strategy was provided in an experiment by Walter and Swinnen (1992). Participants practiced an asymmetric bimanual coordination task that required them to use one arm to move a horizontal lever in a one-direction elbow-flexion movement while at the same time using the other arm to move a lever in a two-direction elbow-flexion-extension movement. One group practiced two sets of twenty trials at reduced speeds before practicing the task at the criterion speed. The other group practiced all trials at the criterion speed. Transfer test results showed that the reduced-speed training group learned to perform the task more accurately than the group that practiced the criterion speed only.
Walter 和 Swinnen （1992）提供了关于减速策略的益处的证据。在他们的实验中，受试者要练习非对称双手协调任务，要求用一只手臂在单方向屈肘运动中移动水平控制杆，同时用另一只手臂在二维屈肘伸展运动中移动控制杆。其中一组参与者在以标准速度练习任务之前，先以较低的速度完成两组20次的练习；而另一组则以标准速度完成所有练习。迁移测试结果表明，与只练习标准速度的组相比，降速练习组在执行任务的过程中表现得更准确。 

***Adding auditory cues.*** Fourth, for skills having a distinct rhythmic characteristic, *providing auditory cues* that specify the appropriate rhythm works well to reduce task difficulty and facilitate a person’s learning of the activity. This approach is especially interesting because it actually simplifies a task by adding an extra component to it. For example, musical accompaniment has been shown to assist Parkinson’s disease patients with gait disorders while they practice walking. An example of research support for this simplification procedure was reported by Thaut et al. (1996). The researchers provided patients with Parkinson’s disease with an auditory device that consisted of audiotapes with metronome sounds embedded in instrumental music to designate the rhythmic structure and tempo (i.e., speed) of the desired walking gait. The patients used the device as part of a three-week home-based gait-training program to pace their steps while walking. Compared to patients who did not use the device, the patients who trained with the auditory accompaniment showed greater improvement in their gait velocity, stride length, and step cadence. In addition, they accurately reproduced the speed of the last training tape without the assistance device. Since that initial study researchers have reported numerous experiments that support the use of auditory cues for gait therapy for Parkinson’s disease patients as well as for patients with other movement disorders (e.g., Rochester, Burn, Woods, Godwin, & Nieuwboer, 2009; Schaffert, Janzen, Mattes, & Thaut, 2019; White, Wagenaar, Ellis, & Tickle-Degnen, 2009), and for therapy for reaching movements with a hemiparetic arm (Malcolm, Massie, & Thaut, 2009). However, more research is needed to determine which movement disorders are most likely to benefit from auditory cueing (Moumdjian, Buhmann, Willems, Feys, & Leman, 2018; Wittwer, Webster, & Hill, 2012).
***添加听觉提示*** 第四，对于具有明显节奏特征的技能，*添加合适的听觉提示*可以很好地降低任务难度，并促进练习者对技能的学习。这种方法特别有趣的一点是它向任务添加了额外的组成部分却使任务得到了简化。音乐伴奏已经被证明可以帮助有步态障碍的帕金森病患者练习走路，Thaut 等人（1996）就报告了支持这一简化策略的研究实例。研究人员为帕金森病患者提供了一种听觉装置，该装置由录制了节拍器声音的录音带组成，节拍器的声音融入到了器乐演奏声中。他们用这种装置来指定训练时行走步态的节奏与速度。患者使用该设备进行为期三周的家庭步态训练计划，一边行走一边调整步伐。与不使用该设备的患者相比，在听觉伴奏下训练的患者在步态速度、步幅和步频方面的改善幅度更大。此外，这些患者还在没有辅助设备的情况下准确再现了最后一盘训练磁带指示的节奏速度。自最初的研究以来，研究人员已经报道了许多实验证据，支持将听觉提示用于帕金森病患者以及其他运动障碍患者的步态治疗（例如，Rochester, Burn, Woods, Godwin, & Nieuwboer, 2009; Schaffert, Janzen, Mattes, & Thaut, 2019; White, Wagenaar, Ellis, & Tickle-Degnen, 2009), and for therapy for reaching movements with a hemiparetic arm (Malcolm, Massie, & Thaut, 2009），和恢复偏瘫手臂的送达运动功能的治疗（Malcolm, Massie, & Thaut, 2009）。然而，还需要更多的研究来确定哪些运动障碍最有可能受益于听觉提示（Moumdjian, Buhmann, Willems, Feys, & Leman, 2018; Wittwer, Webster, & Hill, 2012）。

***Sequencing skill progressions.*** The fifth strategy is related to the progressive part strategy discussed earlier. It involves the *sequencing of skill progressions,* which means that a person practices variations of the skill being learned in a sequence from less to more complex or difficult until the skill itself is practiced. For example, in the discussion in chapter 1 of Gentile’s taxonomy of motor skills, we considered the following task sequence to help young baseball players learn to hit pitches thrown by a pitcher: first, hit baseballs off a tee at the same height; next, hit balls off a tee at different heights; then, hit balls thrown by a pitching machine; and finally, hit balls thrown by a pitcher.
***依次推进练习*** 第五个策略与前面讨论的循序渐进策略有关。这一策略涉及*依次推进练习*，也就是说练习者在练习目标技能之前，要按照复杂性或难度由低到高的顺序依次练习目标技能的各种变化形式。举例来说，在第一章关于 Gentile 运动技能分类的讨论中，我们提到可以按照以下的任务顺序进行练习以帮助青年棒球运动员学习击打投手投掷的球：首先，在相同高度从球架上击打静止球；接下来，在不同高度的球架上击打静止球；然后，击打投球机投出的球；最后，打投手投出的球。

The task progression strategy is commonly referred to in the physical education teaching literature (e.g., Rink, 1998). Also included in this strategy is the use of *lead-up games or activities.* Although the task progression strategy has not received strong research support, results of an experiment reported by Hebert, Landin, and Solmon (2000) provided evidence that supported the learning benefit for an easy-to-difficult task progression of four distances from the net to practice the tennis serve, with the first distance at the service line, and then progressing back to serving from the baseline. Interestingly, this study included a progressive part training condition for the tennis serve in which the parts of the serve were practiced independently and gradually combined together. Although the progressive part condition yielded positive results, an advantage of the task progression strategy was that it led to high success rates for students of low, middle, and high skill levels. Notably, learners reported higher self-efficacy and higher motivation to learn and engaged in greater amounts of appropriate practice when they received easy-to-difficult practice compared to criterion practice from the service line. Similarly, Stevens, Anderson, O’Dwyer, and Williams (2012) reported that increased self-efficacy was associated with the beneficial effects of easy-to-difficult practice relative to difficult-to-easy practice on the learning of a stick balancing task.
在体育教学相关文献中，任务推进策略经常被提及（例如，Rink, 1998），实践中经常通过*引导游戏或准备活动*来使用这一策略。尽管任务推进策略没有得到普遍的研究支持，但 Hebert、Landin 和 Solmon （2000） 报告的一项实验结果表明由易到难的任务推进策略对学习网球发球有益。在实验中，任务难度是按照到网的距离确定的，第一个距离在发球线，然后逐渐向后往底线推进。有趣的是，这项研究还使用了循序渐进法来练习网球发球，其中发球的各个部分一开始独立练习，然后逐渐结合到一起。除了能为技能学习产生积极影响外，任务推进策略的另一个优点是，它提高了不同水平的学生的成功率。值得注意的是，与只在发球线上进行标准练习相比，采用由易到难练习策略的练习者报告具有更高的自我效能感和更强烈的学习动机，并参与了更多的适当练习。同样，Stevens、Anderson、O’Dwyer和 Williams （2012）报告说，在学习木棍平衡的任务中，由易到难的练习相对于由难到易的练习更能提高自我效能感。

***Simulators and virtual reality.*** Finally, *simulators and virtual reality (VR) environments* are technical devices that provide ways to simplify certain features of a skill to help people learn skills. These devices have several advantages: people can practice skills without concerns about the cost of accidents or performance errors that would characterize practice in real environments; practitioners can control specific aspects of the performance environments more easily than in real environments; and people can often practice for longer periods of time and with more intensity than they could in a real environment.
***模拟器与虚拟现实*** 最后，*模拟器与虚拟现实（VR）环境*也可用于简化某项技能的某些部分以帮助人们学习技能。这些设备有几个优点：首先，练习者可以不用像在现实世界中那样担心出现事故或表现错误带来的损失；其次，相比真实环境，练习组织者能更容易地控制表现环境的特定方面；最后，练习者通常可以比在真实环境中进行时间更长、强度更大的练习。

*Simulators* are devices that imitate the environment, vehicles, machines, or instruments. For example, automobile and truck simulators are commonly used to train people to drive these vehicles. The military uses a variety of simulators, such as those for airplanes, tanks, and submarines, to train personnel who will operate these vehicles. In sports, simulators include devices such as pitching machines in baseball and softball, ball machines in tennis, and rebounders in basketball. In medicine, simulators range from very high-tech machines that enable surgeons to practice endoscopic and laparoscopic procedures to low-tech manikins that allow nurses to practice resuscitation skills or rehearse routine patient care procedures. Simulators can be used for training purposes by providing practice experiences before operating the actual device or by providing a practice situation in which certain attention demands are reduced. You read in chapter 13 about an example of the use of a simulator; see the Closer Look box discussion of the study by Weeks et al. (2003) concerning the use of an arm prosthesis simulator to train patients who would be fitted with an actual prosthetic arm.
*模拟器*是用于模拟各种情境、车辆、机器或仪器的设备。例如，驾驶培训中经常会使用汽车和卡车模拟器。军方也使用各种模拟器，如飞机、坦克和潜艇模拟器，来训练即将驾驶这些载具的人员。在体育运动中则有棒球和垒球中的投球机、网球中的球机和篮球中的篮板机等模拟器。在医学领域，模拟器的范围也十分广泛，从让外科医生练习内窥镜和腹腔镜手术的高科技机器到让护士练习复苏技能或排练常规病人护理程序的低技术含量的人体模型。用于培训目的模拟器一方面可以在操作真正设备之前提供练习经验，另一方面可以提供一个减少了某些注意力需求的练习情境。在第13章讨论 Weeks 等人（2003）的研究的深入阅读栏目中举了一个使用模拟器的例子，涉及使用手臂假肢模拟器来训练将安装假肢的患者。

Research investigations of the effectiveness of simulators have been more common for their use as training devices to help people learn to drive cars (e.g., Fisher et al., 2002), pilot airplanes and helicopters (e.g., Stewart, Dohme, & Nullmeyer, 2002), and perform surgical skills (Frank et al., 2018; Howells, Gill, Carr, Price, & Rees, 2008; Kalun, Wagner, Yan, Nousiainen, & Sonnadara, 2018) than for their use in sports contexts. In general, research results support the use of simulators as training devices, especially when they adhere to the similarity principles described in chapter 13 when we discussed why positive transfer occurs. For simulators, these principles concern the degree of similarity between the component parts of the tasks required by the simulator and the real device, between the performance contexts or situations, and between the cognitive processing characteristics.
对模拟器有效性的研究大多集中于将其作为训练设备帮助人们学习驾驶汽车（例如 Fisher et al., 2002），驾驶飞机和直升机（例如 Stewart, Dohme, & Nullmeyer, 2002），以及执行外科技能（Frank et al., 2018; Howells, Gill, Carr, Price, & Rees, 2008; Kalun, Wagner, Yan, Nousiainen, & Sonnadara, 2018），在体育领域应用的研究则不多。总的来说，这些研究结果支持使用模拟器作为训练设备，特别是当它们符合第13章中讨论正迁移发生原因时描述的相似性原则时。模拟器与真实设备之间的相似性包括：模拟器和真实设备执行的任务的组成部分间的相似程度，表现情境之间的相似程度，以及认知处理特征之间的相似程度。

*VR environments* simulate real environments through the use of two and three dimensional computer graphics. The virtual environments can be experienced in real time, which provides a realistic experience in that environment without being in the actual environment. You saw examples of the use of VR training strategies in chapter 13. It is also relevant to note that the training of visual search strategies that was introduced in chapter 9—an excellent example of a part-practice approach to learning—is frequently done in VR environments. Additional examples of VR training reported in the research literature have involved such diverse fields as sports, physical rehabilitation, surgery, and the military. These have included the following:
*VR环境*通过使用计算机图形技术来模拟真实环境。VR环境可以被实时体验，也就是说即使不身处某个环境，使用者也可以获得那个环境的真实体验。第13章中介绍了一些使用VR训练策略的例子，同时在9章中介绍的视觉搜索策略的训练——使用分解练习法学习技能的绝佳例子——也常常在VR环境中进行。体育、身体康复、外科手术和军事等不同领域中也有研究文献报告了使用VR训练的例子，如下所列：

- Teaching a table tennis stroke (Todoroy, Shadmehr, & Bizzi, 1997), rowing (Ruffaldi et al., 2011), and a range of ball sports (Miles, Pop, Watt, Lawrence, & John, 2012)

In each of these situations, the use of a VR environment provided an effective means of practice to either prepare people to perform the skills in a real environment, or augment physical practice in a real environment.
在上述的每一种情境中，VR环境的使用都提供了一种有效的练习手段，用来为练习者做好在真实环境中进行技能练习的准备，或者增强练习者在真实环境中的表现水平。

In a review of the “state of the art” for VR applications in physical rehabilitation, Holden (2005) described available equipment, a scientific rationale for the use of VR in physical rehabilitation, and research that has investigated the effectiveness of VR in physical rehabilitation. The areas of study reviewed in physical rehabilitation include stroke rehabilitation, brain injury, Parkinson’s disease, orthopedic rehabilitation, balance training, wheelchair mobility, and functional activities of daily living. From this review, Holden concludes that people with disabilities are capable of learning in VR environments and that this learning successfully transfers to real-world environments. In an important extension to these conclusions, You et al. (2005) found evidence that VR training resulted not only in improved locomotor recovery but also in neurological benefits. Their fMRI results showed that the VR training induced a reorganization of brain cortex activation from an abnormal ipsilateral to a normal contralateral activation in the sensory-motor cortex, which they described as playing an important role in the recovery of locomotor function for people with chronic stroke. More recently, Bohil, Alicea, and Biocca (2011) and Tieri, Morone, Paolucci, and Iosa (2018) have provided an update on the range of applications for VR training in rehabilitation.
Holden（2005）在物理康复领域中的VR应用的最新发展综述中，描述了可用的设备、在物理康复中使用VR的科学原理以及对VR在物理康复中的有效性的研究。在综述中涉及到的领域包括包括中风康复、脑损伤、帕金森病、骨科康复、平衡训练、轮椅运动和日常生活中的功能性活动。在这份综述的基础上，Holden 做出了如下结论，认为残疾人有能力在VR环境中学习，并且在VR环境中的学习能成功地迁移到现实世界的环境中。在这些结论的一个重要延伸中，You等人（2005）发现的证据则延伸了上述结论，表明VR训练不仅能促进运动能力的恢复，还能带来神经系统方面的好处。他们的fMRI结果显示，VR训练诱发了大脑皮层的重组，产生了从同侧的异常激活到对侧的正常激活，他们认为这在慢性中风患者的运动功能恢复中发挥了重要作用。最近，Bohil、Alicea 和 Biocca（2011）以及Tieri、Morone、Paolucci 和 Iosa（2018）也拓展了VR训练在康复中的应用范围。

A caution against using miming as a simplification method. A common practice in occupational therapy is to have patients mime task performance, or pretend they are performing a task. For example, rather than have a person reach for and grasp a glass of water and drink from it, the therapist asks the person to mime this complete action without the glass present. The problem with this approach is that different patterns of movement characterize the mimed and the real actions.
将模仿作为一种简化策略时需要慎重。职业治疗中的一个常见做法是让患者模仿任务的执行，或者假装他们正在执行任务。例如，医生往往让患者模仿伸手拿茶杯喝水的动作过程，而不是让患者用实物练习。这种方法存在的问题是模仿动作和真实动作的运动模式是有区别的。


Mathiowetz and Wade (1995) clearly demonstrated these movement pattern differences for three different tasks for normal adults and adults with multiple sclerosis (MS). The three tasks were eating applesauce from a spoon, drinking from a glass, and turning pages of a book. The authors compared two different types of miming: with and without the object. For both the normal and the MS participants, the kinematic profiles for the three tasks revealed uniquely different characteristics for the real and the mimed situations.
Mathiowetz 和 Wade（1995年）通过比较正常成年人和患有多发性硬化（MS）的成年人操作三种不同任务，清楚地证明了模仿动作和真实动作之间存在的运动模式的差异。这三项任分别务是用勺子吃苹果酱，用杯子喝水，以及翻书。研究人员比较了两种不同类型的操作：有实物和没有实物。三个任务的运动学分析显示，无论是正常人还是MS患者，真实情境和模仿情景中的动作特征是截然不同的。

Although this experiment and situation relate specifically to a specific patient population in a physical rehabilitation environment, the results have implications for all skill learning situations. When simplifying the practice of a skill, a therapist, teacher, or coach should have the person perform the natural skill. In each of the simplification methods described in the preceding section, this was always the case.
虽然这个实验是在物理康复环境中进行的，并且研究对象是特殊的患者人群，但研究结果对所有的技能学习情境都有意义。在简化技能时，治疗师、教师或教练应该让练习者操作真实的技能。在使用前面所叙述的所有简化方法时，也都应该尽可能地遵循这条原则。



**AN ATTENTION APPROACH TO INVOLVING PART PRACTICE IN WHOLE PRACTICE**
**使用注意调节法在整体练习中包含分解练习**

Sometimes it is not advisable or practical to separate the parts of a skill physically for practice. This, however, does not mean that a learner cannot practice parts of the whole skill. It is possible to practice the whole skill, but focus attention on specific parts that need work. This approach provides both the advantage of part practice, where emphasis on specific parts of the skill facilitates improvement of these parts, and the advantage of whole practice, in which the emphasis is on how the parts of the skill relate to one another to produce skilled performance.
有时，在练习中把技能分成若干个部分是不可取的，也是行不通的，但这并不意味着学习者就不能着重练习技能中的某些部分了。在练习整个技能的过程中，练习者可以把注意力集中在技能的某些需要特别练习的部分上。这种方法兼具分解练习法和整体练习法各自的优点，既强调技能特定部分的练习和提高，也强调技能各部分的衔接。


Both attention theory and research evidence support this attention approach. In Kahneman’s model of attention, which was discussed in chapter 9, an important factor in attention allocation policy is called *momentary intentions.* When applied to a performance situation, this factor comes into play when a person focuses his or her attention on a specific aspect of the performance. Because we can manipulate our attention resources in this way, we can direct attention to a specific part of a skill while performing the whole skill.
注意力理论和研究证据都支持这种注意力调节法。在 Kahneman 的注意力模型中（见第9章），注意力分配策略的一个重要因素被称为*瞬时意图*（momentary intentions）。在执行技能时，当练习者将他们的注意力集中到技能的特定方面时，这一因素就开始发挥作用。由于这种注意力资源利用方式的存在，我们可以在练习整个技能的过程中将注意力指向技能的特定部分。

An example of research evidence supporting the use of this attention-directing strategy for part practice is an experiment by Gopher, Weil, and Siegel (1989). Participants learned a complex computer game, known as the Space Fortress Game, that requires a person to master perceptual, cognitive, and motor skills as well as to acquire specific knowledge of the rules and game strategy. The player must shoot missiles at and destroy a space fortress. He or she fires the missiles from a movable spaceship, controlling spaceship movement and firing using a joystick and a trigger. To destroy the fortress, the player must overcome several obstacles, such as the fortress’s rotating to face the spaceship to defend itself, protection of the fortress by mines that appear on the screen periodically and can destroy the spaceship if it runs into them, and so on (see ManŽ & Donchin, 1989, for a complete description of this computer game).
支持在部分化练习法中使用注意指向策略的研究中，Gopher、Wei 和 Siegel（1989）进行了一项实验，为使用注意力指向策略进行分解练习提供了支持。在他们的实验中，受试者要学习玩一个叫作太空堡垒的游戏，这个游戏十分复杂，要求练习者有很好的知觉能力、认知能力和运动能力，同时还需要受试者掌握特定的游戏规则和游戏策略。玩家必须向太空堡垒发射导弹并将其炸毁，他们从一个运动的飞船上发射导弹，用一个摇杆和扳机控制飞船的行动和射击。为了摧毁堡垒，玩家必须克服多种障碍，例如，堡垒会通过转向飞船的方式来自我保护，屏幕上还会定期出现地雷，这些地雷不仅可以保护堡垒，而且还可以摧毁飞船。（关于这款游戏的完整描述请参阅 ManŽ & Donchin, 1989）

In the experiment, three groups received instructions during the first six practice sessions that emphasized a strategy requiring them to direct attention to one specific component of the skill. One group’s instructions emphasized focusing attention on controlling the spaceship. The second group’s instructions emphasized focusing attention on handling the mines around the fortress. The third group received spaceship control instructions for the first three practice sessions and then mine-handling instructions for the next three sessions. When the researchers compared the performance of these three groups against that of a control group that had not received any strategic instructions, the effectiveness of the attention-directing instructions was evident. As you can see in figure 18.3, the control group improved with practice, but not as much as the three instruction groups did. And the group that received two different strategies outperformed those that received only one.
在实验中，三个小组在前六次练习中接受了关于策略的指导，要求他们将注意力指向技能的特定部分。第一组接受的指导强调将注意集中在飞船的控制上；第二组接受的指导强调将注意集中于躲避堡垒周围的地雷；第三组在前三次练习中接受的指导强调飞船控制，而后三次练习强调躲避地雷。当研究人员将这三个组与另外三个没有接受任何指导的控制组对比时，注意力指向指导的有效性是显而易见的。如图18.3所示，控制组通过练习提高了操作水平，但提高的幅度不如指导组大。同时，接受两种不同策略指导的组比接受一种指导策略的组操作水平提高幅度更大。

These results provide evidence that attention-directing instructions can serve to establish a part-practice environment while allowing the person to practice the whole skill. And these instructions are more effective than having the person practice the skill without providing such strategies. An important connection needs to be made between the use of attention-directing instructions as a part-practice strategy and our discussions in chapters 9 and 14 about the focus of attention. It is notable that the attention-directing instructions for the computer game just discussed emphasized an external attention focus, which as we discussed, consistently results in better learning and performance than an internal focus. The extent to which attention-directing instructions as a part-practice strategy should emphasize an external rather than an internal focus remains a question for researchers to address. 
这些结果证明，注意力指向的方法可以用于在整体练习情境中建立分解练习环境。并且接受这类策略指导的学习者比没有策略指导的学习者的学习更有效。这里有必要指出作为分解练习策略的注意力指向法与在第9章和第14章中讨论的注意焦点[!!待统一]之间的联系。刚才讨论的电子游戏中的注意力指向指导强调了外部的注意力焦点，而正如前文所述，外部注意力焦点相较于内部焦点总是能带来更好的学习效果和表现水平。作为一种分解练习策略实施时，注意力指向指导应该在多大程度上强调外部焦点而不是内部焦点，这仍然是研究者需要解决的问题。


**SUMMARY**
**本章小结**

Make the initial decision to use a whole- or part-practice strategy on the basis of the *complexity* and *organization* characteristics of the skill. Use a whole-practice strategy when the skill is low in complexity and high in organization; use a part-practice strategy when the skill is higher in complexity and is lower in organization.
练习的最初阶段选择整体还是分解练习策略应该以技能的*复杂性*和*组织性*特征为依据。低复杂性、高组织性的技能应采用整体练习策略；高复杂性、低组织性的技能应采用分解练习策略。

Parts of a skill that are interdependent in terms of their spatial and temporal performance characteristics should be practiced together as a “natural unit”; parts that are relatively independent in terms of their spatial-temporal relationships can be practiced separately.
如果技能某些部分的时空表现特征相互依赖，应该将它们作为“自然单元”放到一起练习；而对于技能中时空表现特征相对独立的部分可以单独进行练习。

Three methods of part practice were discussed:
三种分解练习法的讨论：

- *Fractionization* is the practicing of an individual arm or leg of an asymmetric coordination task involving the arms or legs and then practicing them together.
- *部分化法*是指学习不对称协调任务中手臂、腿的动作时，首先单独练习一侧手臂或腿的动作，之后再将这些动作结合起来进行练习的方法。

- *Segmentation* is a progressive part method that involves practicing parts in sequence such that the first part is practiced until it can be performed at a certain performance level and then the next part is added and practiced, and so on until the skill is practiced as a whole.
- *分割法*是指按照一定次序练习技能各个部分的渐进练习法，具体而言，是指在技能的第一部分练习到一定的表现水平之后，加入下一部分的练习并将两个部分连接在一起练习，以此类推直到完整执行整个技能为止。

- *Simplification* involves simplifying parts of the skill, or of the whole skill. We considered several different simplification methods, each of which is specific to certain types of skills or skill characteristics: reducing the difficulty of objects, reducing the attention demands, reducing the performance speed, adding auditory cues, sequencing task progressions, and using simulators and virtual reality (VR) environments.
- *简化法*是指将技能的各个部分或者整个技能简化后进行练习的方法。我们介绍了多种不同的简化法，但每种方法都是针对特定类型的技能或技能特征制定的：降低操纵物的难度；降低注意力需求；提供听觉伴奏；降低操作速度；采用任务渐进；使用模拟器和虚拟现实（VR）环境。

An effective whole-skill-practice strategy is to direct attention focus on a specific part of the skill while performing the whole skill.
一种有效的整体练习策略是在练习整个技能的过程中将注意集中在技能的某些特定部分。

**POINTS FOR THE PRACTITIONER**
**实践要点**

Before deciding whether to practice a skill as a whole or by parts, analyze the skill to identify its component parts.
在决定采用整体练习还是分解练习之前，先分析要练习的技能，找出它的组成部分。

After analyzing a skill and identifying its parts, determine the degree to which the performance of any one part depends on the performance of the preceding part. When parts are characterized with this relationship, the parts should be practiced together as a unit rather than as separate parts.
在分析完技能并确定其组成部分后，接下来确定每一个部分的表现与前一部分的表现在多大程度上相关。如果某些部分被认定具有这种关系，那这些部分应该作为一个单元一起练习，而不是作为单独的部分进行练习。

It is important not to assume that because parts can be identified they should be practiced separately; the performance dependence on preceding and following parts should always direct the decision concerning which parts to practice separately and which parts to practice together.
因为技能的部分清晰可辨所以就单独练习各个部分的想法是不可取的。决定哪些部分单独练习、哪些部分一起练习的最重要的因素始终是前一部分和后一部分在执行上的依赖性。

When the parts of a skill follow a specific sequence of movements, the preferred way to engage in part practice is the progressive part method in which parts are practiced in sequence and become increasingly larger until the whole skill can be practiced in its entirety.
当一项技能的各个部分遵循特定的动作顺序时，进行分解练习的首选方法是渐进法。在这种方法中，练习者每次会练习越来越多的技能部分，直到可以完整地练习整个技能。

When practicing the parts of a skill is not advisable or possible, consider ways to simplify the whole skill before engaging people in performing the skill as it would be performed in its real-world context.
如果单独练习技能的某些部分不可取或不可行时，在让练习者在实际情境中执行技能前，应该考虑对完整的技能进行简化。

When the technology is available, simulator and virtual reality training provide excellent initial means of engaging people in practicing a skill before having them practice the skill as it would be performed in its real-world context.
如果技术条件允许，在练习的初始阶段，使用模拟器和虚拟现实是极好的练习方法。这些方法可以让练习者在实际情境中执行技能前练习技能。

Directing attention to a part of a skill while performing the whole skill can be an effective way to correct errors for parts of a skill that should not be practiced as separate parts.
在执行整个技能时，将注意力指向技能的某一部分可能是一种有效的方法，可以调和技能中某些部分无法单独练习的矛盾。
