**Imagery Training as a Posture Development Technique**
**表象练习作为一项体态恢复技术**

Two experiments by Fairweather and Sidaway (1993) showed that imagery training can help people diagnosed with postural problems related to abnormal curvature of the spinal column. In one of these experiments, participants were seventeen-year-old males who regularly experienced low back pain and were assessed as having varying degrees of lordosis and kyphosis. The authors compared two different treatments. One involved flexibility and abdominal exercises; the other involved deep muscular relaxation exercises prior to kinesthetic awareness exercises and visualization practice. The visualization technique consisted of creating images of four different action situations involving trunk, buttocks, pelvis, and thighs. For example, participants were told to visualize their buttocks as unbaked loaves of dough and watch them slide downward toward their heels. Results showed that following a three-week training period during which participants engaged in their respective techniques, only the imagery training led to improved postural form, as measured by spinal angles, and a reduction in back pain.
Fairweather 和 Sidaway（1993）进行的两项实验均表明，表象练习可以帮助脊柱异常弯曲的患者恢复体态。在其中一项实验中，被试为17岁男性患者，经常感到下背部疼痛，同时被诊断为不同程度的脊柱前凸症和驼背。研究人员对两种不同的治疗方法进行了比较，其中一组包括灵活性练习和腹部练习；另外一组在肌肉运动知觉练习和视觉表象练习之前先做深层肌肉放松练习。视觉表象由涉及躯干、臀部两侧、骨盆和大腿几个部位的四种不同的运动情境组成。例如，受试者被告知想象看见他们臀部两侧像两大块生面团沿着大腿滑向脚跟。研究结果显示，两组按照各自的方法训练三周后，只有表象练习改善了体态（通过测量脊柱角度），并减轻了背痛。

**Using Mental Practice in a Physical Therapy Treatment Program**
**在物理治疗计划中使用心理练习**

A case study by Page, Levine, Sisto, and Johnson (2001) showed that when mental practice was combined with physical practice, it effectively complemented a physical therapy program for a fifty-six-year-old male with upper-limb hemiparesis due to a subacute stroke five months earlier. The patient’s arm function had not improved since he had been discharged from the hospital, where he had received thirty days of inpatient physical therapy. During the study, the patient received the following protocol:
在 Page、Levine、Sisto 和 Johnson（2001）研究的一个案列中，患者为56岁男性，因5个月的前亚急性中风，引起上肢轻度偏瘫。患者的康复治疗将心理练习法与物理练习法结合使用，结果表明，这种方法可以有效地完成身体康复计划。患者曾接受过30天的康复治疗，但出院后手臂功能并没有得到改善。研究过程当中，患者收到如下建议：

**Physical therapy:** Three times per week, in 1 hr segments, for six weeks. The exercises in each session involved the arms for 30 min and the legs for 30 min according to the neurodevelopmental treatment (NDT) method.
**物理治疗**：每周3次，每次1小时，持续6周。根据神经发展治疗法（NDT）的要求，每次练习包括手臂练习和腿部练习各30分种。

**Mental practice:** Two times per week for 10 min in a quiet room 20 min after a physical therapy session; and two times per week at home. Following 2–3 min of relaxation activities, the patient listened to an audiotape for 5–7 min. The tape included commands for the patient to see himself (external imagery) performing three functional tasks with the affected arm. Each task was mentally practiced for two weeks: reaching for and grasping a cup; turning pages of a large reference book; and reaching for and grasping an item on a high shelf and then bringing the item to himself.
**心理练习**：每周两次，一次在安静的房间10分钟，一次在物理练习后用时20分钟；每周在家也进行两次。在2~3分种放松活动之后，患者聆听磁带5~7分钟。磁带中包含指令，要求患者想象看到自己（外部表象）用病手操作三个功能性任务。每个任务进行两周心理练习：伸手拿茶杯；翻一本又厚又大的参考书；伸手够高架上的物品并将其拿到手中。

Pretest and posttest comparisons showed the following results:
前测和后测的结果如下：

Wrist and finger control improvements, according to performance on the Fugl-Meyer Scale
Fugl-Meyer 量表上的表现显示，手腕和手指的功能得到改善

Grip, grasp, and pinch improvements, according to performance on the Action Research Arm Test (ARA)

Improvements in six of the ten items of the Stroke Rehabilitation Assessment of Movement (STREAM)

**The Relationship between Working Memory and Mental Practice in Stroke Patients**
**脑卒中患者工作记忆与心理练习的关系**

In a study of stroke patients carried out by researchers in Canada (Malouin, Belleville, Richards, Desrosiers, & Doyon, 2004), the verbal, visuomotor, and kinesthetic domains of working memory capabilities were compared to the effectiveness of a combination of physical and mental practice for stroke patients who had motor impairment on one side of their body (hemiparesis). The motor skill practiced was a stand-and-sit task. The motor performance characteristic of interest was the degree of symmetry of vertical forces for each leg, which was assessed by a force plate for each leg.
在加拿大的研究人员对中风患者进行的一项研究（Malouin, Belleville, Richards, Desrosiers, & Doyon, 2004）中，针对身体一侧有运动障碍（轻偏瘫）的中风患者，比较了他们的言语、视觉和动觉的工作记忆容量的与物理和心理结合练习的有效性。练习的运动技能是一项站立-坐下任务，关注的运动表现特征是每条腿垂直发力的对称程度（使用测力板测量）。

**_Working memory tests_** (standardized tests found in Spreen & Strauss, 1998):The experimenter presented a series of items that each patient had to reproduce immediately in the same order. The items for each type of test were
_工作记忆测试_ （Spreen和Strauss（1998）中提出的标准化测试）：实验者展示一系列项目，患者必须立即以相同的顺序重现这些项目。每种类型测试的项目分别是

_Verbal:_ Lists of two and three commonly used and easy to imagine monosyllabic words
_言语：_ 两三个常用且容易想象的单音节单词

_Visuomotor:_ Experimenter tapped on a series of nine blocks randomly
_视觉：_ 实验人员以随机顺序敲击九个方块

_Kinesthetic:_ Experimenter produced a series of gestures that involved unilateral and bilateral lower-limb movements; movements of the trunk, the intact upper limb, and the affected lower limb (e.g., lift the heel of the unaffected leg with the toes remaining in contact with the floor; flex the trunk forward and touch the affected ankle with the unaffected hand; bring the heel of the affected foot forward and the toes of the unaffected foot backward)
_动觉：_ 实验人员做出一系列需要单侧和双侧下肢运动的手势以及需要用躯干、健康的上肢和患病的下肢完成的动作（例如：抬起健康侧的脚跟，同时脚趾保持与地板接触；向前弯曲躯干，并用健康侧的手触摸患病侧的脚踝；使患病侧的脚跟向前同时使健康的脚趾向后）

**_Motor performance task:_** Patients sat on a chair with each foot on a force plate. They were instructed to stand without using their hands until they heard a tone and then sit down. They were shown on a computer monitor the amount of vertical force that was overloaded on the unaffected leg and told to try to reduce that amount while increasing the amount on the affected leg.
_运动表现任务:_ 患者坐在椅子上，每只脚放在测力板上。他们被指示在不使用手的情况下保持站立，在听到声音后坐下。电脑显示器上显示了他们健康侧腿上的垂直力的过载量，并被告知在增加患侧腿上的力的同时，尽量减少该量。

**_Physical and mental practice:_** During a familiarization training session, patients performed the motor performance task and were asked to verbalize how they planned and executed the task. Practice involved a series of five-trial blocks of one physical practice trial followed by four mental practice trials, during which they closed their eyes while seated and imagined they were standing and sitting. They indicated to the experimenter when they began and ended each trial.
_物理练习和心理练习:_ 在热身训练中，患者执行运动表现任务，并被要求用语言描述他们是如何计划和执行任务的。而练习则包括一个由五个试验块、每个试验块包含一次物理练习组成的练习序列以及四次心理练习试验。在此心理练习期间，受试者坐着闭上眼睛，分别想象他们站着以及坐着。受试者向实验者指明每次试验的开始和结束时间。

**_Results—mental practice effect:_** The patients improved the amount of force on the affected leg during their standing up and sitting down after just one session of mental practice combined with physical practice. This improvement was maintained one day later on a retention test.
_结果——心理练习效果：_ 患者仅在进行一次心理与物理结合练习后，站立与坐下时患肢的作用力就有所改善。这种改善在一天后的保留测试中依旧存在。

**_Results—working memory relationship:_** The amount of improvement on the motor performance task was related to the patients’ working memory capabilities. Patients with higher visuomotor working memory scores showed a greater amount of performance improvement. Patients who had impairments on at least two working memory domains had smaller amounts of motor task improvement and demonstrated no lasting improvement on the retention test.
_结果——与工作记忆的关系：_ 运动表现任务的改善程度与患者的工作记忆容量有关。视觉运动工作记忆水平较高的患者表现出更大程度的表现改善。至少在两类工作记忆上有损伤的患者运动任务改善量较小，并且在保留测试中没有表现出持久的改善。
