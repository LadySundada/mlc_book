**APPLICATION**
**应用**

Situations in which teachers, coaches, and therapists can use mental practice range from helping a patient employ mental practice to relearn a skill to aiding a world-class athlete perform in a major competitive event. Consider the following three examples.
心理练习应用的范围非常广，从促进患者恢复执行技能的能力到帮助世界级的运动员完成重大比赛, 心理练习都有所帮助。下面我们看三个实例。

A gymnast is standing beside the floor exercise mat waiting to begin her routine. Before actually beginning that routine, the gymnast goes through the entire routine mentally, visualizing the performance of each part of the routine, from beginning to end. Following this, the gymnast steps onto the mat and begins the routine.
一名体操运动员正站在比赛场地旁，等待开始表演体操套路。在开始表演这个套路之前，体操运动员会在心中回想整个套路，在脑中从头到尾将套路中每个部分的表现细节具象化，接下来才会步入比赛场地开始她的套路表演。

A stroke patient is having difficulty walking down a flight of stairs. After several failed attempts, the patient is becoming frustrated. The therapist tells the patient to stop practicing and instead to stand on the top step and mentally visualize and feel herself walking down the stairs perfectly ten times in a row. The patient goes through the entire sequence mentally on each practice attempt. Following this procedure, the therapist has the patient go back to physically practicing this skill.
一名中风患者难以走下一段楼梯。几次尝试失败后，患者变得沮丧起来。治疗师告诉患者停止练习，并站在最高的台阶上，在心中具象化并感受自己连续10次成功地走下楼梯的场景。患者在以后的每次练习时都要先在心中走完整个流程。完成这个过程之后，治疗师开始让患者重新开始练习下楼的技能。

You are playing golf and have just hit a beautiful drive down the middle of the fairway. You would like to hit a few practice drives to try to reproduce and reinforce the swing that produced such a wonderful result. Although you can’t do that, you _can_ practice that swing mentally as you walk down the fairway to your next shot.
如果你正在打高尔夫球，并且刚刚沿球道中路打出了漂亮的一击。你也许希望能再打几个一样漂亮的球以增强对这次挥杆的记忆，但现实中几乎不可能做到。尽管如此，你*还是可以*在头脑中多次回想刚刚打出漂亮一击的挥杆动作，为下一次击球做准备。

Notice that each of these three situations had a different goal for mental practice. The gymnast used mental practice to prepare for an immediate performance of a well-learned routine. The rehabilitation patient used mental practice to reacquire a skill. Finally, the golfer used a mental practice procedure to reinforce an appropriate action and thereby aid an upcoming performance of that action.
请注意，在上面三种情境中心理练习的目标是有所区别的：体操运动员用心理练习为即将表演的熟练套路做准备；康复患者利用心理练习重新学习技能；高尔夫球手利用心理练习巩固某一个击球动作，以便在未来执行同样的动作。

**DISCUSSION**
**讨论**

In the motor skill learning and performance literature, the term _mental practice_ refers to the cognitive rehearsal of a physical skill in the absence of overt physical movements. We should not confuse this type of mental practice with meditation, which generally connotes an individual’s engagement of his or her mind in deep thought in a way that blocks out awareness of what is happening to or around him or her. We can think of meditation as a form of mental practice; in fact, it seems to be a potentially effective means for enhancing physical performance.
讨论在动作技能学习和操作的相关文献中，*心理练习（m
ental practice）* 指的是在不进行外显身体动作的条件下，在头脑中对身体技能进行认知演练。我们不应该将心理练习与冥想相混淆，后者通常是指个体完全地投人到深思当中，封闭一切外界对意识的干扰。当然，我们也可以把冥想看作是心理练习的一种形式，而且冥想完全有可能是一种有待于开发的提高技能水平的有效途径。

In this discussion, we limit the term **mental practice** to mean active cognitive or mental rehearsal of a skill, where a person may think about the cognitive or procedural aspects of a motor skill or engage in visual or kinesthetic imagery of the performance of a skill or part of a skill. When a person engages in mental practice, an observer would notice no movement related to the skill. Mental practice may occur while a person observes another person live, another person on film or video, or himself or herself on film or video. Or it may occur without any visual observation at all.
在本章的讨论中，**心理练习**的含义被限定为对技能的主动认知或心理演练，练习者可能在头脑中回忆动作技能的认知结构或动作执行的流程，或者对技能或技能中的某些部分的执行进行视觉表象或动觉表象。

When mental practice involves visual imagery, it can take the form of either internal or external imagery. In _internal imagery,_ the individual approximates the real-life situation in such a way that the person actually “imagines being inside his/her body and experiencing those sensations which might be expected in the actual situation” (Mahoney & Avener, 1977, p. 137). During _external imagery,_ on the other hand, the person views himself or herself from the perspective of an observer, as in watching a movie.
心理练习中的视觉表象有外部表象和内部表象之分。在*内部表象*过程中，个体通过“想象在自己的身体里并体验那些实际情况中可能会出现的感觉”（Mahoney & Avener, 1977, p. 137）的方式来预估实际情况。而在*外部表象*过程中，个体从一个观察者的角度从外部看待自己，就像看电影一样。

Although most discussions of the use of imagery as mental practice involve visual imagery, it is important to note that imagery can take the form of kinesthetic imagery. This form of imagery engages a person in feeling the movements of a skill. Unfortunately, there is very little research that has investigated the use of kinesthetic imagery. But the research available suggests that it can be an effective means of mental practice (e.g., Dickstein & Deutsch, 2007; Féry, 2003; Hall, Buckolz, & Fishburne, 1992). Because of our limited knowledge about kinesthetic imagery, discussions of imagery in this chapter will address visual imagery.
尽管人们通常所讨论的心理练习中的表象大多指视觉表象，但有必要指出的是，表象还包含另外一种重要形式，即动觉表象，这种表象让练习者感受一项技能的运动状态。令人遗憾的是，目前关于动觉表象应用的研究还非常少见。但仅有的研究可以证明，动觉表象是一种非常有效的心理练习方法（例如，Dickstein & Deutsch, 2007; Féry, 2003; Hall, Buckolz, & Fishburne, 1992）。由于我们对动觉表象的了解还十分有限，本章将主要介绍视觉表象。

It is also important to note that the type of imagery involved in mental practice differs from the imagery that we discussed in chapter 10 as a memory strategy to enhance performance. The imagery associated with mental practice involves the person imagining himself or herself performing the actual skill, whereas the imagery described as a memory strategy is a metaphoric image in which the skill to be performed is mentally imagined as the movements of something like the skill—such as the mental image often suggested to help beginning swimmers learn the arm coordination pattern for the sidestroke by imagining that one arm reaches to pick an apple off the tree and then brings the apple down to put it in a basket held by the other hand at waist level.
同样值得注意的是，心理练习中涉及的表象与我们在第10章中讨论的用于提高表现水平的表象记忆策略并不相同。与心理练习相关的表象指的是练习者想象自己在实际执行的技能，而与记忆策略相关的表象指的是一个比喻的意象，具体来说就是把要执行的技能在心中想象为某些类似技能的动作——比如，学习侧泳的手臂协调动作的初学者可以想象伸出一只手臂到苹果树上摘下一个苹果，然后把苹果放到另一只手臂环抱在腰部的篮子中，这种表象通常对侧泳初学者有帮助。

**TWO ROLES FOR MENTAL PRACTICE**
**心理练习的两种作用**

The study of mental practice as it relates to the learning and performance of motor skills follows two distinct research directions. One concerns the role of mental practice in the _acquisition_ of motor skills. Here the critical question is how effective mental practice is for a person in the initial stages of learning or relearning a skill. The other research direction addresses how mental practice can aid in the _performance preparation_ of a learned skill.
与运动技能的学习和表现相关的心理练习研究主要有两个方向。研究方向之一是关于心理练习在技能的习得过程中的作用。这里的关键问题是，在学习或重新学习一项技能的初始阶段，心理练习能起到多大的效果。另一个研究方向是心理练习如何有助于已习得技能的表现。

People use mental practice as a performance aid in two ways. You saw the first in the gymnast example in the Application section. The gymnast used mental practice to prepare for the immediately upcoming performance. When used this way, mental practice is _a means of action preparation_, which we discussed in chapter 8. You saw the second approach in the example of yourself as a golfer, mentally imaging a successful swing as you walked down the fairway. Here mental practice combines characteristics of both acquisition and performance situations by providing a person with _a means of facilitating the storage and retrieval from memory_ of an appropriate action.
心理练习作为技能操作的辅助手段通常有两种用途。前面关于体操运动员赛前的心理练习属于第一种，体操运动员利用心理练习为即将到来的表演做准备，这时的心理练习是*运动准备*的一种手段。而高尔夫球手在下一次击球前心中不断想象成功挥杆动作的例子则展示了心理练习的第二种用途。因此，心理练习在学习情境和表现情境中都能发挥作用，即心理练习*不仅能促进动作的存储，还可以促进动作从记忆中的检索*。

Beginning as early as the 1890s, the research literature is replete with mental practice studies. Several excellent reviews of this research literature can be consulted for more specific information than will be discussed here (e.g., Dickstein & Deutsch, 2007; Guillot, Hoyek, Louis, & Collet, 2012; Martin, Moritz, & Hall, 1999; Moran, Campbell, Holmes, & Macintyre, 2012; Schuster et al., 2011). These reviews describe the convincing research support for the concept that mental practice is an effective strategy for aiding both skill acquisition and performance preparation.
早在19世纪90年代，研究文献中就涉及了大量关于心理练习的研究。许多关于这些研究的文献综述提供了非常有参考价值的信息（例如，Dickstein & Deutsch, 2007；Guillot, Hoyek, Louis, & Collet, 2012；Martin, Moritz, & Hall, 1999；Moran, Campbell, Holmes, & Macintyre, 2012; Schuster et al., 2011）。在这些研究回顾当中，描述了许多有说服力的证据证明心理练习对技能学习和表现准备的有效作用。

**MENTAL PRACTICE AIDS SKILL ACQUISITION**
**心理练习有助技能习得**

Research investigations of the effectiveness of mental practice in motor skill acquisition typically compare mental practice, physical practice, and no practice conditions. In general, results show that physical practice is better than the other conditions. However, mental practice is typically better than no practice. This finding alone is important, because it demonstrates the effectiveness of mental practice in aiding skill acquisition. Even more impressive is the effect of using _a combination of physical and mental practice_.
在动作技能习得的研究当中，为了验证心理练习的效用，研究人员通常会比较心理练习、物理练习和无练习三种条件下的学习效果。大多数研究结果显示，物理练习比其他练习条件产生的学习效果更好，而心理练习能够比无练习的条件产生的学习效果更好。单独从心理练习的角度来看，这个发现还是非常有价值的，因为它证明了心理练习对于技能习得的促进作用。更令人印象深刻的是结合物理练习和心理练习的效果。

One of the more extensive comparisons of combinations of mental and physical practice was an experiment by Hird et al. (1991). The researchers compared six different physical and mental practice conditions. At one extreme was 100 percent physical practice, while at the other extreme was 100 percent mental practice. In between were practice routines requiring 75 percent physical and 25 percent mental practice, 50 percent physical and 50 percent mental practice, and 25 percent physical and 75 percent mental practice. The sixth condition required neither physical nor mental practice, but had participants doing a different type of activity during the practice sessions. Participants practiced two tasks. One required them to place as many round and square pegs in appropriately marked places in the pegboard as they could in 60 sec. The other was a rotary pursuit task in which the target moved in a circular pattern at 45 rpm for 15 sec.
Hird 等人（1991）的实验对心理和物理练习的多种组合方式进行了比较。研究人员共对比了六种不同的身体和心理练习条件：一个极端条件是100%的物理练习，而另一个极端是100%的心理练习；介于两者之间的是75%物理练习加25%心理练习、50%物理练习加50%心理练习、25%物理练习加75%心理练习；最后一个条件既没有物理练习也没有心理练习，但在其他组进行练习时，要求这一组的被试进行与其他组的学习任务不相同的活动练习。所有受试者要完成两项任务：第一个任务需要他们在60秒内尽可能多地在钉板上的指定位置插上圆形和方形的木栓；另一个是转盘追踪任务，转盘上的目标会以45转/分的速度转动15秒。

Results of this experiment (figure 19.1) showed three noteworthy effects. First, consistent with other research findings was the result that mental practice alone was better than no practice for both tasks. Second, as the proportion of physical practice increased for both tasks, the level of posttest performance rose. Third, although physical practice alone was better than combinations of mental and physical practice, the differences were small.
实验结果（见图19.1）显示了三个值得注意的结论：第一个结论与其他研究发现一致，在两个任务的学习中，心理练习产生的学习效果均要比无练习组好；第二，两个任务的学习中随着物理练习比例的增大，后测的操作水平也相应升高；第三，虽然单纯的物理练习比心理练习和物理练习相结合的方法效果要好，但差异并不大。

The relative similarity in learning effects between physical practice only and combinations of physical and mental practice has been a common finding in research. In fact, an experiment by Allami and colleagues (2008) in France included mental and physical practice combinations like those in the Hird et al. (1991) study and reported similar results. What is especially important to note is that the use of a combination of physical and mental practice often involves only half as many physical practice trials as physical practice only.
关于单纯物理练习与心身结合练习对技能学习影响差异不显著的结果在其他研究中也常有报告。Allami 及其同事（2008）在法国进行的一项实验中包含了与 Hird 等人类似的物理练习和心理练习的组合，得到了类似的结果。之所以要强调这一结果，是因为采用物理与心理结合练习后，物理练习量下降到了单纯物理练习的一半。

_Why would a combination of mental and physical practice trials lead to learning effects that are as good as physical practice only?_ We can derive one answer to this question by considering some points discussed throughout this text about the need to engage in effective practice strategies. An important characteristic of effective strategies for optimizing skill acquisition is cognitive problem-solving activity. Physical practice appears not to be the only means of establishing these beneficial conditions. Mental practice can invoke them as well, although not to the same extent. However, the combination of physical and mental practice appears to establish a learning condition that can optimize these important characteristics.
*为什么物理与心理结合的练习方法产生的学习效果能够和单纯物理练习产生的学习效果一样好呢？* 贯穿本书始终的、对有效练习策略规律的探讨，也许能给出我们这个问题的答案。实现技能习得的最有效策略具有一个重要特征，就是练习中包含解决问题的认知活动。显然，物理练习不是建立有效的练习情境的唯一途径，心理练习同样可以做到，只是程度不同而已，而身体和心理练习相结合的学习方法则可以最大化这些重要特征。


**Mental Practice Benefits in Rehabilitation Settings**
**康复领域中的心理练习**

In addition to being beneficial for acquiring new skills, mental practice can be effective in rehabilitation contexts for the relearning of skills, as well as for the improvement of skill performance. Mental practice is actually becoming increasingly popular as a therapeutic tool because it has several advantages relative to physical practice. For example, it enables interventions to begin very early in the recovery process, when little or no movement might be possible, it is inexpensive, it can be done anywhere, and it involves no safety risks (Munzert, Lorey, & Zentgraf, 2009).
除了有利于习得新技能外，心理练习在康复领域中还可以有效地促进技能的再学习和技能操作的改进。心理练习正成为一种越来越受欢迎的治疗工具，因为它相对于物理练习有几个优点。例如，它使干预措施能够在恢复过程的早期就开始，那时患者可能几乎没有运动能力；同时心理练习成本低廉、可以在任何地方进行并且不会有任何安全风险（Munzert, Lorey, & Zentgraf, 2009）。

Examples of research concerning physical rehabilitation applications of the use and effectiveness of mental practice include poststroke patients (e.g., Cho, Kim, & Lee, 2012; Dickstein, Dunsky, & Marcovitz, 2004; Liu, Chan, Wong et al., 2009; Malouin, Richards, Duran, & Doyon, 2009; Page, Levine, & Leonard, 2005, 2007; also see Guerra, Lucchetti, & Luchetti, 2017, for a systematic review and meta-analysis of research on imagery training after stroke), elderly people with walking balance problems (e.g., Linden, Uhley, Smith, & Bush, 1989; Nicholson, Keogh, & Choy, 2018), teenagers with abnormal curvatures of the spine (Fairweather & Sidaway, 1993), and injured athletes (Christakou, Zervas, & Lavallee, 2007; Driediger, Hall, & Callow, 2006). The results of this research have consistently supported the functional skill rehabilitation benefit of mental practice, especially in the form of visual and kinesthetic imagery, along with physical practice.
在康复领域中对心理练习的使用方式和有效性的研究包括了对脑卒中后的患者（例如，Cho, Kim, & Lee, 2012; Dickstein, Dunsky, & Marcovitz, 2004；Liu, Chan, Wong et al., 2009；Malouin, Richards, Duran, & Doyon, 2009；Page, Levine, & Leonard, 2005, 2007；关于卒中后的表象训练的研究文献的系统综述与元分析可见 Guerra, Lucchetti, & Luchetti, 2017）、有行走平衡问题的老年人（例如 Linden, Uhley, Smith, & Bush, 1989；Nicholson, Keogh, & Choy, 2018）、脊柱弯曲异常的青少年（Christakou, Zervas, & Lavallee, 2007; Driediger, Hall, & Callow, 2006）和受伤的运动员（Christakou, Zervas, & Lavallee, 2007；Driediger, Hall, & Callow, 2006）等的研究。这些研究的结果一致支持了心理练习，特别是视觉表象和动觉表象与物理练习相结合的练习方式，对功能性技能恢复的益处。

For example, Page et al. (2005) engaged patients who had a stroke for more than one year in mentally practicing activities of daily living (ADLs) in addition to their regular physical performance of those activities during 30 min therapy sessions, two days a week for six weeks. A control group of similar patients practiced relaxation techniques in addition to their physical performance of the activities. Results showed that the patients who participated in the mental practice protocol improved their use of their affected limb more than those in the control group.
例如，Page 等人（2005）的实验中让一组中风一年以上的患者在为期6周，每周两天，每天30分钟的康复课上除了对各种日常技能（ADLs）进行物理练习，还要对这些技能进行心理练习。而情况类似的对照组患者则是在物理练习之外练习放松技巧。结果显示，使用的患者比对照组患者在患肢使用方面获得了更大的改善。

Another example of research evidence for the effectiveness of mental practice for physical rehabilitation involved active athletes with grade II ankle sprains (Christakou, Zervas, & Lavallee, 2007). One group of these athletes received twelve individual mental practices (i.e., imagery rehearsal) plus their regular course of physical therapy, while a second group received only the regular physical therapy treatment. The mental practice involved imagery of the same exercises experienced during the physical therapy treatment on each day. Results showed that the addition of mental practice to the athletes’ regular physical therapy during the course of treatment improved muscular endurance more than the physical therapy alone. The combined benefit of mental practice and physical practice over physical practice alone appears to be a consistent finding in the rehabilitation literature (see Moran et al., 2012). [For an extensive review of research on the use of motor imagery for upper limb rehabilitation, see Harris and Hebert, 2015; and for a meta-analysis of research on mental imagery effects on functional mobility, see Zach et al., 2018.]
另一项对二级踝关节扭伤的现役运动员的研究（Christakou, Zervas, & Lavallee, 2007）也显示了心理练习对身体康复的有效性。研究中一组运动员在常规的身体治疗之外还接受了12次单独的心理练习（即表象演练），而另一组运动员只接受了常规的身体治疗。心理练习的具体措施是想象每天在身体治疗过程中进行的练习。结果表明，常规身体治疗与心理练习相结合比单独进行身体治疗更能提高肌肉耐力。康复领域中的各种文献一致表明了这种物理与心理结合练习相较于单独物理练习的益处（见 Moran et al., 2012）。[关于运动表象用于上肢康复的研究的广泛综述，见 Harris and Hebert, 2015；关于心理表象对功能活动影响研究的元分析，见 Zach et al., 2018。]

**Mental Practice Benefits for Learning Medical Procedures**
**心理练习有助于学习手术操作**

For the same reasons that clinicians have been drawn to mental practice as a supplement to physical practice during rehabilitation—cost, ease of use, and lack of risk—medical schools have also been drawn to mental practice as a supplement to physical practice in the teaching of medical procedures. Mental practice is a particularly attractive form of practice when patient safety concerns and the costs associated with purchasing high-tech surgical skills simulators are taken into consideration. Anecdotal reports have documented that highly accomplished surgeons use mental practice extensively, particularly when preparing for surgery (Gladwell, 1996). Moreover, several recent studies have confirmed that mental practice can enhance the learning of medical procedures (Arora et al., 2010, 2011; Bramson, 2011; Cocks et al., 2014).
正如外科医生出于成本、易用性和无风险性而让患者采用心理练习作为康复期间物理练习的补充那样，医学院在教授手术操作时也开始使用心理练习作为物理练习的补充。考虑到病人的安全问题和购买高科技手术技能模拟器的费用，心理练习确实是一种特别有吸引力的练习形式。据坊间传闻，高水平的外科医生都会大量进行心理练习，尤其是在准备手术时（Gladwell, 1996）。此外，最近的几项研究证实，心理练习可以增强手术操作的学习（Arora et al., 2010, 2011; Bramson, 2011; Cocks et al., 2014）。

For example, Arora et al. (2011) randomly assigned twenty novice surgeons to practice a virtual- reality laparoscopic procedure on five separate trials with or without mental practice. Participants in the mental practice group engaged in 30 min of mental practice prior to performing each procedure whereas participants in the control group watched an online lecture. All participants completed a questionnaire to assess the quality and richness of their visual imagery prior to each of the five physical practice trials. No group differences were found on prepractice skills testing; however, the mental practice group performed the procedure significantly better than the control group on all five practice trials. Importantly, the quality of the imagery reported by the mental practice group was significantly higher than that reported by the control group and imagery quality was significantly correlated with the quality of performance. These findings show that mental practice can be a cost-effective way to augment the traditional training of surgical skills and they also highlight the important role that imagery quality may play in influencing the quality of physical performance.
以 Arora 等人（2011）的研究为例。他们将20名新手外科医生随机分配为心理练习组和无心理练习组，在五个独立的试验中练习虚拟现实腹腔镜手术。心理练习组的受试者在执行每一个手术之前进行30分钟的心理练习，而对照组的受试者则观看在线课程。在五次物理练习试验之前，所有受试者都填写了一份问卷，以评估他们视觉表象的质量和丰富程度。实验结果表明，在预练习测试中没有发现群体差异；然而，在所有五个练习试验中，心理练习组的手术表现明显好于对照组。更重要的是，心理练习组报告的表象质量明显高于对照组报告的表象质量，并且表象质量与表现水平显著相关。这些发现表明，要改善传统的外科技能培训，心理练习会是一种性价比很高的方法；此外，该研究还强调了表象质量可能对物理表现水平造成的重要影响。

**Mental Practice Benefits for Power and Speed Training**
**心理练习有助于力量训练与速度训练**

A characteristic of many motor skills is the need to generate speed over relatively short distances. Sprint events in running, bicycling, and crew are examples of skills involving this characteristic. An experiment by Van Gyn, Wenger, and Gaul (1990) demonstrated that mental practice can be beneficial for improving power for people learning a 40 m bicycle sprint. After being pretested on a bicycle ergometer (stationary bicycle) to determine peak power for a 40 m sprint, participants began three training sessions each week for six weeks on the bicycle ergometer to improve power performance. Two groups imaged themselves performing the sprint eight times. One of these groups did only the mental practice, whereas the other imagery group did imagery practice while they practiced physically. A third group received only the power training. A fourth group served as a control group by receiving neither the imagery nor the power training. The results showed the benefits of combining mental and physical practice. Only the group that received both the imagery and the power training showed an improvement in sprint times at the end of the six-week training period. More recently, Reiser, BŸsch, and Munzert (2011) have reported strength gains on a range of different tasks, including bench pressing, leg pressing, triceps extension, and calf raising, with various combinations of physical and mental practice.
许多动作技能都具有在相对短的距离内产生较大速度的特征。短距离赛跑、短距离自行车赛和接力比赛等都具有这类特征。Van Gyn、 Wenger 和 Gaul（1990）的实验证明，心理练习有助于提高40米短距离自行车练习者的力量。在用自行车测力计（即固定的自行车）确定了40米短距离力量的最大值后，为了提高力量成绩，受试者用自行车测力计进行为期6周每周3次的力量训练。训练中的物理练习要求受试者必须持续最大速度至少10秒钟。两个心理练习组要想象自己进行了8次冲刺；其中一组只做心理练习，而另一组在进行心理练习的同时也进行物理练习。第三个练习组只进行单纯的力量练习，第四个练习组作为控制组既不进行心理练习也不进行力量练习。实验结果支持了物理和心理结合练习带来的好处。只有同时接受心理练习和力量练习的实验组在6周的训练后提高了冲刺成绩。最近，Reiser、BŸsch 和 Munzert （2011）也报告了各种物理练习和心理练习的组合提升了一系列不同任务的力量表现，包括卧推、腿部推举、颈后臂屈伸和小腿伸展等。

The training of movement speed has also been shown to be influenced by mental practice. For example, in two experiments by Louis and colleagues (2008) in France, participants practiced two tasks, one involving an upper body sequence, the other a lower body sequence. Included in the practice sessions were trials in which participants practiced at self-chosen speeds as well as at speeds that were faster and slower than those speeds. For mental practice, two groups engaged in visual internal imagery of performing the sequences: one group at a faster speed than their self-chosen speeds, the other at a slower speed. One week after the training period of thirty trials on each of fifteen days both groups were asked to perform the two sequences at a self-chosen speed. Interestingly, each group performed faster or slower than their original self-chosen speed, depending on which speed they mentally practiced during the sequences.
研究也证明心理练习可以影响速度训练的效果。
运动速度的训练也被证明受到心理练习的影响。例如，在法国学者 Louis 及其同事（2008）的两个实验中，受试者要练习两项任务，一项是上半身的一套动作，另一项是下半身的一套动作。在练习环节中，受试者以自己选定的速度以及稍慢/稍快于该速度进行练习。在心理练习中，两组受试者都进行了该套动作的内部视觉表象，但是一组以快于选定的速度进行练习，另一组以慢于选定的速度进行练习。在为期15天、每天练习30次的练习周期结束后的一周，两组受试者被要求以先前自己选定的速度执行这两套动作。有趣的是，两组的执行速度都和原先选定的速度不同，快慢取决于他们心理练习时速度。

**Mental Practice as Part of a General Preparation Strategy that Aids Learning**
**心理练习作为常规准备策略促进技能学习**

We see an interesting example of incorporating mental practice into a practice routine in a five-step general learning strategy which was originally proposed by Singer (1986, 1988). This strategy involves elements of mental practice in three of the steps. The first step is to get ready physically, mentally, and emotionally. The second step involves mentally imaging performing the action, both visually and kinesthetically. The third step involves concentrating intensely on only one relevant cue related to the action, such as the seams of a tennis ball. The fourth step is to execute the action. Finally, the fifth step is to evaluate the performance outcome.
Singer（1986,1988）在研究中，把心理练习合并到练习计划中，这种新颖的训练方法曾引起了很多人的关注。在他提出的一个五步学习策略中有三步包括了心理练习的内容：第一步是学习者从身体、心理和情绪上做好学习的准备；第二步在头脑中表象执行动作的情景，包括视觉表象和动觉表象两种方式；第三步将注意高度集中于与动作有关的线索上，如网球球体上的接缝；第四步是完成动作；最后，第五步是评价操作结果。

Several studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of this general strategy for learning a specific skill. For example, Kearney and Judge (2017) compared secondary school students who used this strategy with those who didn’t to learn a task involving a modified basketball free-throw shooting task and then transferring to performing a golf putting task. During three sets of 10 trials on each of two days, one group used the Singer five-step strategy, described in the previous paragraph, prior to practicing the skill each day; a second group received information each day about the evolution and biomechanics of the free-throw. All participants performed the golf task one month later, with no strategy provided. Results showed that the strategy group significantly improved their free-throw performance during the practice period, while the no-strategy group showed no improvement. More notably, on the golf transfer test, the strategy practice group performed more accurately than the no-strategy practice group.
多项研究已经证明这种学习策略对学习特定技能的作用。例如，Kearney 和 Judge （2017）让中学生学习调整过的篮球罚篮任务，然后比较使用五步策略和没有使用五步策略的中学生在迁移到高尔夫推杆任务上的表现。在为期两天、每天三组、每组十次的练习中，一组在每天练习该技能之前，使用了上一段中描述的 Singer 五步策略；另一组则是每天收到关于罚球的技能提高情况和相关生物力学指标。一个月后，所有受试者都在没有提供策略指导的情况下执行了高尔夫推杆任务。结果表明，使用策略组在练习期间的罚球成绩得到显著提高，而无策略组则没有提高。更值得注意的是，在高尔夫迁移测试中，策略练习组的表现比无策略练习组更准确。

**MENTAL PRACTICE AIDS PERFORMANCE PREPARATION**
**心理练习有助于表现准备**

In their review of the research literature related to imagery use in sport, Martin, Moritz, and Hall (1999) described five types of imagery that athletes use for various purposes (see table 19.1). The specific situations in which athletes used imagery were in training periods between competitive events, immediately prior to and during a competitive event, and when they were rehabilitating an injury. Because it would be beyond the scope of this textbook to discuss the three motivational types of imagery, only the two cognitive types will be discussed in this chapter (for a more detailed discussion of motivational types of imagery, see Hall, Rodgers, & Barr, 1990 and Murphy, 1994). With regard to the types of imagery described in the Martin et al. study, it is important to point out that although the study specifically addressed the use of imagery by athletes, you should not limit the use of imagery in these situations to athletes. The use of imagery can benefit anyone engaged in a situation in which he or she must perform a practiced skill for evaluation purposes, as evident from the prior reference to accomplished surgeons.
Martin、Moritz 和 Hal（1999）对心理表象在运动领域的应用研究进行了回顾，总结出运动员用于不同目的的五种表象（见表19.1）。运动员使用表象的情境包括：训练阶段、比赛即将开始阶段、比赛过程当中和伤病恢复阶段。在这里讨论三种动机性表象超出了本书的介绍范围，因此我们在这章将只介绍两种认知性的表象练习（更多动机性表象的内容详见 Hall, Rodgers, & Barr, 1990 and Murphy, 1994）。尽管 Martin 在研究中详细描述了几种类型的表象，但是非常有必要指出的是，虽然这项研究只介绍了运动员使用的表象练习，我们不能因此而限制表象练习在其他领域的作用。其实，在任何以评价为目的的情境中，表象练习都能有效地促进技能的表现。

Surveys and anecdotal evidence indicate that athletes use imagery as part of their preparation strategies for a variety of purposes. Among these are arousal-level regulation, attention focus, and the maintenance of positive and confident feelings. This means that prior to competition, athletes tend to use the motivational types of imagery described in table 19.1. Unfortunately, because of the lack of controlled research investigations on the effectiveness of these imagery strategies, empirically based conclusions are not possible. The primary research problem is that in what would seem to be a simple investigation that compares athletes who use an imagery preparation strategy with those who don’t, there are no established valid methods for determining if those in the imagery group actually used an imagery strategy, and if they did, what it involved. However, given this limitation, the Martin et al. (1999) review indicates that researchers have reported sufficient evidence to provide “tentative support” (p. 256) for the benefits of the use of imagery as an effective competition preparation strategy.
调查发现，运动员把表象练习纳入他们准备策略有多种目的，包括调节唤醒水平、集中和保持注意力、保持积极和自信的情绪状态。这就意味着在比赛之前，运动员较多采用表19.1介绍的动机性表象。令人遗憾的是，在受控条件下，还没有研究能证明这些表象策略的有效性，而以实践经验为基础的结论并不十分可靠。研究中最主要的问题是，如何在一种简单的实验设计中对使用和不使用表象准备策略进行比较，而且，目前还没有一种有效的途径来确定实验中的表象组是否真正使用了动机性表象策略，如果使用了，又难以确定使用的表象策略包括了哪些内容。然而，尽管研究存在诸多限制，Martin 等人（1999）在研究综述中指出，研究人员已经提供了充分的证据以“尝试性”地证明（p.256）动机性表象练习是一种有效的竞赛准备策略。

**WHY IS MENTAL PRACTICE EFFECTIVE?**
**为什么心理练习是有效的？**

At present, there are no comprehensive theories that explain why mental practice in the form of imagery is effective (see Martin et al., 1999, for a discussion of proposed explanations). However, there are three generally accepted hypotheses that propose why mental practice benefits the learning and performance of specific motor skills which we discuss next.
目前还没有一个理论能全面地解释心理练习法产生作用的机制（关于已有假说的讨论见 Martin et al., 1999）。然而，关于心理练习能够促进动作技能学习和表现的解释中，有三个假说得到了普遍认可。

**A Neuromuscular Hypothesis**
**神经肌肉假说**

We can trace the notion that mental practice of a motor skill has a neuromuscular basis to the work of Jacobson (1931). When he asked people to visualize bending the right arm, Jacobson observed EMG activity in the ocular muscle, but not in the biceps brachii. However, when he asked them to imagine bending the right arm and lifting a 10 lb weight, he noted EMG activity in the biceps brachii on more than 90 percent of the trials. Since Jacobson’s early study, many other researchers have provided evidence for this type of electrical activity in the muscles of people asked to imagine movement (e.g., Bakker, Boschker, & Chung, 1996; Decety, 1996; Dickstein et al., 2005; Kobelt et al., 2018).
这一假说最早可以追溯到 Jacobson（1931）的研究，即运动技能的心理练习有神经肌肉基础。当他要求受试者具象化弯曲右臂的动作时，Jacobson 观察到受试者的眼部肌肉出现了 EMG 活动，但二头肌没有。而当他要求被试想象弯曲右臂并提起4.5千克重物时，发现二头肌的 EMG 活动水平达到了实际操作的 EMG 活动水平的90%以上。继 Jacobson 的研究之后，许多研究都提供了表象运动过程中相关肌肉会出现类似电活动的证据。

The creation of electrical activity in the musculature involved in a movement as a result of the performer’s imaging of an action suggests that the appropriate neuromotor pathways involved in the action are activated during mental practice. This activation aids skill learning by helping establish and reinforce the appropriate coordination patterns that are so essential to develop. For someone performing a well-learned skill, this activation tunes, that is, primes, the neuromotor pathways that will be activated when the person performs the skill. This tuning process increases the likelihood that the person will perform the action appropriately and reduces the demands on the motor control system as it prepares to perform the skill.
运动过程中才会出现的肌肉组织的电活动，出现在了动作表象的练习过程中，这说明与动作表现有关的运动神经通路在心理练习的过程中被激活了。运动神经通路的激活有助于建立和强化适当的协调模式，以促进技能学习。对于执行已习得技能的练习者来讲，这种激活可以调节（即使之进入状态）那些操作时需要激活的运动神经通路。这一调节过程提高了练习者适当执行这项技能的可能性，同时降低了准备这项技能过程中运动控制系统的工作量。

**Brain Activity Hypothesis**
**脑活动假说**

The results of brain imaging studies have shown that when a person imagines moving a limb, brain activity is similar to when the person physically moves the same limb. Thus, as with the neuromuscular hypothesis, the brain activity hypothesis proposes that mental practice, especially in the form of imagery, is effective because of neurophysiological similarities between the imagined and the actual movements. The idea that imagined and actual movements have similar neurophysiological bases has been referred to as the _functional equivalence_ hypothesis (Jeannerod, 2001; Moran et al., 2012). Interestingly, imagined movements also activate several of the same brain regions that are activated when someone observes another person perform a movement (Grzes and Decety, 2001; Hardwick, Caspers, Eickhoff, & Swinnen, 2018). An example of the research supporting this hypothesis is an experiment by Lafleur et al. (2002) in which PET scans showed changes in brain region activity as a result of mentally practicing a sequence of left-foot movements. At the beginning of training, brain activity associated with the physical execution of the movements was observed bilaterally in the dorsal premotor cortex and cerebellum, as well as in the left inferior parietal lobe. After training, these areas were no longer active but increased activity was observed bilaterally in the frontal cortex and striatum, as well as in the anterior cingulated and a different region of the inferior parietal lobe. The researchers observed similar patterns of brain activity when participants imagined the sequence of foot movements. In addition to these results based on the use of PET scans researchers who have used fMRI to investigate this issue have reported similar findings of the brain region activity relationship between imagined and actual movements (e.g., Ehrsson, Geyer, & Naito, 2003; Hanakawa, Dimyan, & Hallett, 2008; Page, Szaflarski, Eliassen, Pan, & Cramer, 2009. Also, see Ruffino et al., 2017, for a review of neural plasticity research related to imagery). The general consensus seems to be that imagining a movement engages an extensive neural motor network that involves the premotor cortex, the supplementary motor area, the motor cortex, the basal ganglia, and the cerebellum, that is, the same network of brain regions involved in the planning and execution of movements (Jeannerod, 2001; Munzert et al., 2009). However, similar to the conclusions they reached about action observation and action execution (see chapter 14), Hardwick et al. (2018) have suggested that the similarities in brain activation patterns between imagined and executed movements may have been overestimated by prior researchers.
脑成像研究的结果表明，想象移动某个肢体时的脑活动与实际移动那个肢体的脑活动类似。因此，与神经肌肉假说类似，脑活动假说认为，心理练习（尤其是以表象的形式进行的）之所以有效，是因为想象的运动和实际的运动之间的具有神经生理学意义上的相似性，这种相似性的观点又被称为*功能对等（functional equivalence）* 假说（Jeannerod, 2001；Moran et al., 2012）。有趣的是，想象的运动同时也激活了另外几个脑区，而这些脑区与观察别人执行这一动作时激活的脑区相同（Grzes and Decety, 2001；Hardwick, Caspers, Eickhoff, & Swinnen, 2018）。支持这一假设的研究的一个例子是  Lafleur 等人（2002）的一项实验。该实验通过 PET 扫描显示心理练习一系列的左脚运动会改变脑区活动：训练开始时，在双侧的背侧运动前皮质和小脑以及左侧顶叶下观察到了与实际执行运动相关的大脑活动；训练后，这些区域不再活跃，但在双侧额叶皮质和纹状体、前扣带回和顶叶下的不同区域观察到了活动的增加。在受试者想象脚的运动顺序时，研究人员也观察到类似的大脑活动模式。除了这些基于 PET 扫描的结果之外，使用 fMRI 研究这一问题的研究人员也报告了想象运动和实际运动之间大脑区域活动关系上的类似发现(例如，Ehrsson, Geyer, & Naito, 2003；Hanakawa, Dimyan, & Hallett, 2008; Page, Szaflarski, Eliassen, Pan, & Cramer, 2009；关于与表象相关的神经可塑性研究的综述可见 Ruffino et al., 2017)。普遍的共识似乎是，想象某个运动涉及到十分广泛的神经运动网络，包括运动前皮层、辅助运动区、运动皮层、基底神经节和小脑，这些脑区与参与运动计划和执行的脑区网络相同。然而，与他们得出的关于动作观察和动作执行的结论相似（见第14章），Hardwick 等人（2018）提出，想象动作和执行动作之间大脑激活模式的相似性可能被先前的研究人员高估了。

**A Cognitive Hypothesis**
**认知假说**

As you studied in chapter 12, researchers generally agree that the first stage of learning a motor skill involves a high degree of cognitive activity. Much of this activity is related to questions about “what to do” with this new task. It should not be surprising, then, that mental practice would be an effective strategy for people acquiring a new skill or relearning an old one. Mental practice can provide the person answers to many performance-related questions without the pressure that accompanies physical performance of the skill. In the later stages of learning, mental practice can be beneficial in assisting the person to consolidate strategies as well as to correct errors.
认知假说在第12章中我们曾经介绍过，研究人员普遍支持在运动作技能学习的初始阶段要涉及高级认知活动。大部分这类活动都与“接下来做什么”的问题有关。也许这正是心理练习成为新技能学习和技能再学习的一种有效策略的原因所在。心理练习可以使学习者在没有实际执行压力的条件下，解决许多与动作执行有关的问题。在随后的学习阶段里，心理练习可以帮助学习者巩固所学的技能，纠正表现中出现的错误动作。


**MENTAL PRACTICE AND IMAGERY ABILITY**
**心理练习与表象能力**

Although researchers have proposed both physiological and psychological reasons for the effectiveness of mental practice for learning and performing motor skills, a related factor also might be operating. There is evidence indicating that the effectiveness of the use of imagery as a form of mental practice is related to a person’s **imagery ability,** which is the ability to image an action when requested to do so. Some people have great difficulty imaging a described action, whereas others can image with a high degree of vividness and control.
虽然研究人员已经从生理和心理的角度分别解释了心理练习对于动作技能学习和再学习的作用，但还有一个相关因素可能会影响心理练习的效果。有证据显示，作为心理练习的一种形式，心理表象能起到多大作用与练习者的**表象能力**有关，即想象动作的能力。对一些人而言，表象别人描述的动作非常困难，而另一些人能够对动作形象和运动情境进行清晰、生动的表象。

Evidence demonstrating that imagery ability is an individual-difference variable comes from research using tests of movement imagery, such as the Movement Imagery Questionnaire (MIQ), a test of imagery ability designed specifically to apply to motor skill performance (Hall & Martin, 1997; Hall & Pongrac, 1983).1 Recall from our discussion in chapter 3 that an ability refers to a relatively stable characteristic that indicates a person’s potential to perform skills in which that ability is an important component.
通过运动表象能力测试进行研究得出的结果证明，表象能力具有个体差异性。运动表象能力量表（MIQ）就是一种运动表象能力测试，在动作技能研究中专门用来测量表象能力（Hall & Martin, 1997；Hall & Pongrac, 1983）。回顾一下第3章的讨论，能力指的是一个相对稳定的特征，表明了个体在特定技能执行中获得成功的潜力，而表象能力无疑是其中的一个重要组成部分。

The MIQ consists of various action situations that a person is asked to physically perform. Then the person is asked to do one of two mental tasks, to either “form as clear and vivid a mental image as possible of the movement just performed” or “attempt to positively feel yourself making the movement just performed without actually doing it.” In this test, the first mental task is called “visual imagery,” whereas the second mental task is called “kinesthetic imagery.” After performing one of these mental tasks, the person rates how easy or difficult it was to do it. A person may be able to do both visual and kinesthetic imagery easily, do one easily and the other with difficulty, or do both with difficulty.
MIQ 由受试者可以实际执行的各种动作情境组成。例如，测试中包含了两个心理任务，要求受试者择一完成：“尽可能清晰、生动地表象出刚刚完成的动作”或“不实际执行，尝试积极地感受刚刚完成的动作”。上述的第一个心理任务称为“视觉表象”，而第二个任务称为“动觉表象”。在完成两个任务中的一个之后，会让受试者评价完成任务的难易程度。有的人能够同时轻松地完成视觉表象和动觉表象，有的则只能轻松地完成其中的一个，还有的人无论完成哪一个都非常困难。

Because imagery ability is an individual-difference variable, Hall proposed that _imagery ability influences the success of mental practice_. People with a high level of imagery ability will typically more quickly benefit from mental practice of motor skills than those with a low level. Evidence supporting this hypothesis was provided in a study by Goss et al. (1986). In this study the researchers selected people who were categorized from their MIQ scores as high visual/high kinesthetic (HH), high visual/low kinesthetic (HL), or low visual/low kinesthetic (LL). Before each practice trial of four complex arm movement patterns, participants kinesthetically imaged the movement about which they received instructions. Support for the hypothesis was provided by the results showing that the HH group performed the patterns to criterion in the fewest trials, with the HL group next, and the LL group taking the greatest number of trials to achieve criterion. Retention performance showed a similar effect.
正因为表象能力具有个体差异，Hall 指出，*心理练习能否成功实施直接受到表象能力的影响*。相比于表象能力差的人，心理练习更容易对表象能力强的人产生帮助。为了验证这个假说，Goss 等人（1986）把他们根据 MIQ 的得分筛选出的受试者按照如下特征分类：高视觉表象能力/高动觉表象能力（HH）、高视觉表象能力/低动觉表象能力（HL）和低视觉表象能力/低动觉表象能力（LL）。一共要练习四种复杂的手臂运动，每次练习之前，受试者都要按动作指示进行动觉表象。研究结果支持了前面的假说：HH组用了最少的练习次数就达到了表现标准， HL组次之，LL组用了最多的练习次数达到表现标准，保留测试中也得到了类似的结果。

Results such as those in the Goss et al. study have led some researchers to question whether the high and low imagery ability effects are due to differences in motivation or the ability to concentrate. An experiment by Lovell and Collins (2002) addressed this question by recording electroencephalograms (EEGs) at various brain sites for males who were classified as high or low on movement imagery according to the MIQ. Because of the EEG brainwave activity characteristics during mental imagery across several practice sessions, the authors concluded that their results provided evidence that levels of movement imagery ability were not merely motivation or concentration effects, but related to _distinct neurological processing characteristics associated with the ability to produce mental movement images_.
与 Goss 等人的结论类似的研究结果使一些研究人员产生了另一个疑问，即表象能力高低对心理练习的影响是否是由于动机差异或集中注意力的能力不同而引起的。Lovell 和 Collins（2002）通过实验回答了这个问题。实验中受试者均为男性，先根据 MIQ 得分进行分类，然后记录受试者进行表象练习时不同脑区的脑电图（EEG）。根据多次表象练习的 EEG，研究人员得出结论：运动表象能力水平不仅仅受动机或注意力的影响，而且与*独特的神经加工特征和运动表象能力联合作用有关*。

The importance of these experiments is that they support the hypothesis that a relationship exists between imagery ability and the effectiveness of mental practice. In addition, they demonstrate that people with low imagery ability can benefit from mental practice.
这些实验的重要性在于它们验证了表象能力与心理练习之间存在关系的假设。此外，它们还证明表象能力低的人也能受益于心理练习。

**SUMMARY**
**本章小结**

Mental practice involves the cognitive rehearsal of a skill in the absence of overt physical movement.
心理练习指的是在不进行外显身体动作的条件下，在头脑中对身体技能进行认知演练的练习方法。

Mental practice can take the form of thinking about the cognitive or procedural aspects of a motor skill or seeing or feeling oneself perform-ing a skill or part of a skill.
心理练习可以采取的形式包括：回想运动技能认知或程序化的方面，以及对技能或技能的一部分进行视觉或动觉的表象。

Research evidence shows that mental practice can be effective as a practice strategy to facilitate the learning and relearning of motor skills and as an action preparation strategy to prepare to perform well-learned skills.
研究结果显示，心理练习作为练习策略可以有效地促进动作技能的学习和再学习，同时也是执行习得技能的一种有效的表现准备策略。

As a practice strategy, mental practice works best when used in combination with physical practice of the skill being learned or relearned.
作为一种练习策略，心理练习在与物理练习结合使用时能发挥最大的作用。

Three hypotheses have been proposed to account for why mental practice is effective:
关于心理练习作用机制的三个假说：

\1. The neuromuscular hypothesis is based on research evidence showing EMG recordings in muscles that would be involved in the actual physical performance of the imaged skill.
神经肌肉假说提出的基础是表象练习中与表象动作相关肌肉的 EMG 记录会出现与实际执行中相同的变化趋势。

\2. The brain activity hypothesis proposes that similar brain regions are activated during the imagining of a movement and the physical execution of that movement. Evidence from research involving brain imaging techniques supports this hypothesis.
脑活动假说认为，在想象运动和实际执行运动的过程中激活了类似的大脑区域。有采用脑成像技术的研究证据支持了这一假说。

\3. The cognitive hypothesis points to the benefit of mental practice for answering questions concerning “what to do” that are prevalent during the first stage of motor skill learning.
认知假说指出，心理练习之所以能够发挥作用是因为心理练习可以解答动作技能学习的最初阶段出现最多的“接下来做什么”的问题。

The ease or difficulty a person may have in using imagery as a form of mental practice is related to a person’s imagery ability. However, regardless of a person’s level of imagery ability, he or she can benefit from mental practice.
作为心理练习的一种方式，表象练习实施的难易程度由练习者的表象能力决定。然而，不管练习者的表象能力如何，他们都能受益于表象练习。

**POINTS FOR THE PRACTITIONER**

Use mental practice as a supplement to physical practice for people who are initially learning a skill.
对于刚开始学习一项技能的学习者，使用心理练习作为物理练习的补充。

Either internal or external imagery can be effective as forms of mental practice.
内部表象或外部表象都可以作为心理练习的有效形式。

To help people learn motor skills, emphasize the use of both visual and kinesthetic forms of imagery as mental practice.
为了帮助人们学习运动技能，强调使用视觉表象和动觉表象的方式进行心理练习。

Expect some people to need training in how to mentally practice.
可能有练习者需要接受如何进行心理练习的培训。

When used to prepare to perform a skill just prior to its performance in a specific situation, mental practice can be used as a way to control anxiety levels and to prepare the specific strategies and/or movements required to perform the skill in the upcoming situation.
在技能表现准备情境中，可以使用心理练习来控制焦虑水平，并提前准备在即将到来的情境下表现技能所需的特定策略和/或动作。

Because individual differences exist in how people will engage in mental practice, provide opportunities for people to develop their own ways of implementing mental practice.
由于在使用心理练习的方式上存在个体差异，这就为练习者提供了发展出自己实施心理练习方式的机会。
