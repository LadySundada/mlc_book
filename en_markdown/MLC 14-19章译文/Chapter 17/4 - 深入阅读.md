**Relating Practice Distribution and Contextual Interference to Skill Learning Contexts**
**在技能学习情境中同时考虑练习分布与背景干扰**

The concept of contextual interference can be incorporated into practice distribution by organizing practice sessions to include principles related to both. The following are some examples that relate to three different skill learning contexts.
通过安排恰当的练习计划，练习课可以同时包含背景干扰效应和练习分布的基本原则。下面就是在三种不同的技能学习情境中进行这种安排的例子。

**Physical education class.** If several drills or other kinds of activity are planned for the day’s lesson, use a station-organization approach by assigning each skill or activity to a location in the gym or on the field so that there are several stations. Divide the class into groups and assign each to a station. Let the groups stay in their stations for about 12–15 minutes and then rotate to the next station. Continue this rotation approach for the entire period. If the class period is sufficiently long, allow for two or more rotations.
**体育课** 如果为一天的课程安排了几种练习或其他类型的活动，使用站点组织法，将每个技能或活动分配到体育馆或训练场地的一个位置，以形成几个站点。将班级分成小组，并给每个小组分配一个站点，让各组在各自的站点停留大约12-15分钟，然后轮换到下一个站点，并在整个训练周期内继续进行轮换。如果上课时间足够长，可以允许两次或更多的轮换。

**Sports-related practice.** Practices for team and individual sports typically include several activities. Rather than spend an extended amount of time on any one activity, divide in half the amount of time planned for each activity, and do each activity as two sets during practice. The two sets can be randomly or serially scheduled during the practice session.
**运动相关的练习** 无论是团体还是个人，对某项运动的练习通常包括几项活动。与其在任何一项活动上花费大量时间，不如将每项活动的计划时间一分为二，并以此在练习过程中将每项活动分成两组。这两组可以在练习期间随机安排或序列安排。

**Physical rehabilitation session.** Like sports-related practice sessions, rehab sessions typically involve several activities. If the planned activities allow, apply the approach described for sports-related practice by dividing in half the total amount of time planned for each activity, and do each activity as two randomly or serially scheduled sets during the session.
**身体康复疗程** 像体育相关的练习课一样，康复课通常也包括几项活动。如果计划的活动允许，应用上面描述的关于体育相关练习的方法，将每项活动计划进行的总时间一分为二，在康复课上随机安排或序列安排这两组活动。[!! 不好处理，直译很怪，只能这样译了，但相较原文损失了一些信息量，先标注一下，留待后面润色]

To enhance the learning of continuous motor skills, such as jumping rope, practice sessions should follow distributed schedules.
为了提高练习运动技能（如跳绳）的表现，应该使用分布练习来安排练习计划。
