**Figure 14.1** An example of use of the point-light technique in motor learning research. (a) The model demonstrating the throwing of a small ball at a target. (b) A static image of the point-light display of the model’s arm with lights at the shoulder, elbow, and wrist joints. (c) Four still frames of the video shown to subjects. From left to right, these depict the arm at the start of the throw, at maximal flexion, at release of the small ball, and at completion of the throw. *Source:* From Williams, J. G. (1989).

**FIGURE 14.3** Angle-angle diagrams of the left knee and left hip for two people practicing on the slalom ski simulator. Both graphs show the relationship of these joints after one day of practice. The top graph is from the person who watched a skilled model demonstrate; the lower graph is from the person who did not watch a demonstration. *Source:* From Schoenfelder-Zohdi, B. G.

Mean form score 平均形态得分
Acquisition blocks 习得时间块
Mean accuracy score 平均准确性得分
Retention 保留测试
Combination 联合练习组
All-prepracticed 全预练习组
Interspersed 穿插练习组
**FIGURE 14.4** The results of the experiment by Weeks and Anderson showing form and accuracy scores for practice trials and retention tests for an overhand volleyball serve for three groups that observed ten skilled demonstrations in different amounts and at different times before and during practice. The form scores represent the mean of ten aspects of form, each rated on a scale of 0 to 5, with 0 indicating a complete absence of the aspect, and 5 indicating the aspect was performed as recommended.

**图 14.4** Weeks 和 Anderson 的实验结果，呈现的是在练习前或练习期间的不同时间获得不同数量示范的三组被试，在练习和保留测试中发飘球的动作形态和准确性得分。动作形态得分代表 10 个形态项的平均值，每一项按 0~5 分计分，0 分表示完全缺失该形态项，5 分表示该形态项完全是按要求执行的（资料来源：Weeks, D. L., & Anderson, L. P. (2002). The interaction of observational learning with overt practice: Effects on motor learning. *Acta Psychologica, 104,* 259–271.）

To teach goalkeeping skills, the instructor must decide when to use demonstrations and when to provide verbal instructions.
为了更好地教授守门技巧，教练必须决定什么时候使用示范，什么时候提供口头指导。
