**Perceiving a Throwing Action from Observing a Point-Light Display**
**通过光点演示感知到投掷动作**

An experiment by Williams (1988) provides an example of the use of the point-light technique. Eighty adults (ages eighteen to twenty-five years) and eighty children (ages fourteen to fifteen years) observed a video point-light display of a side view of the arm of a seated person throwing a small plastic ball at a target (see figure 14.1). The video showed only dots of light at the shoulder, elbow, and wrist joints of the person throwing the ball. The author showed participants the video three times and then asked them what they had seen. Results showed that 66 percent of the children and 65 percent of the adults responded that they had seen a throwing motion. An additional 25 percent of the adults and 23 percent of the children made this response after seeing the video one additional time.
Williams (1988) 的实验是使用标记点技术进行研究的范例。研究人员招募了80位成年人（18至25岁）与80位儿童（14至15岁），请他们观看某端坐个体用单侧手臂向目标投掷塑胶球的标记点演示录像（见图14.1）。该录像仅记录了该人投掷时手臂的肩、肘、腕三个关节标记点的运动。实验者向被试者放映了三遍路线，随后询问他们看到了什么。结果显示，66%的儿童和65%的成人报告他们看到了投掷动作；另外25%的成人和23%的儿童在多看一次录像后也报告了同样的内容。

**Clinical Implications of a Mirror Neuron System**
**镜像神经元系统的临床意义**

In a review of mirror neuron research, Pomeroy and colleagues in London, England (Pomeroy et al., 2005), concluded that the existence of a human mirror neuron system in the brain suggests the beneficial use of observation-based therapy for the rehabilitation of upper-arm movement in poststroke patients. 
在一篇关于镜像神经元研究综述中，Pomeroy 和他在英国伦敦的同事（Pomeroy et al., 2005）得出结论，大脑中存在人类镜像神经元系统表明观察疗法（observation-based therapy）对中风后患者上臂运动的康复是有益的。
The therapy would involve stroke patients observing a healthy person’s arm movements during goal-directed activities. Since that proposal, researchers have reported experiments that have found support for the benefit of observational learning (referred to as “action observation” by rehabilitation researchers) for improving arm and hand function of stroke patients, especially when combined with regular physical therapy (e.g., Celnik, Webster, Glasser, & Cohen, 2008; Small, Buccino, & Solodkin, 2012). Researchers have also shown that stroke patients can benefit from observing their own movements using a technique known as *feedforward video self-modeling*. 
这种疗法会让中风患者观察健康人的手臂在有目标的活动中的移动。自该方法提出以来，研究人员报告了一些实验，这些实验支持了观察学习（康复研究人员称为“动作观察（action observation）”）对改善中风患者手臂和手部功能的益处，尤其是在与常规物理治疗相结合时(例如，Celnik, Webster, Glasser, & Cohen, 2008; Small, Buccino, & Solodkin, 2012)。研究人员还发现，中风患者可以通过使用一种称为“*前馈视频自我示范*（feedforward video self-modeling）”的技术来观察自己的动作。
For example, Steel et al. (2018) videotaped stroke patients performing a simple reaching and grasping task with their affected and un-affected arm. The videos were edited such that the patients could observe either their best movements with their affected arm or a video-reversed version of their movements with the un-affected arm that was designed to create the illusion the affected arm could perform the task proficiently. Significant improvements in performance on the task with the affected arm and in movement self-confidence were seen after the patients simply watched the videos three times per day over one week.
例如，Steel 等人（2018）拍摄了中风患者用他们的患臂和健康臂执行简单的伸手和抓握任务的视频，然后编辑视频，让患者观察他们患臂的最佳动作，或者他们健康臂动作的倒放（目的是造成患臂也可以熟练完成任务的错觉）。在超过一周的时间里，患者每天只需观看三次视频，就可以看到患臂的表现水平和患者对自己动作的自信心有显著提高。

**Beginners Learn by Observing Other Beginners: Learning the Tennis Volley**
**初学者通过观察其他初学者学习网球截击球**

**Participants:** Female university students who had no previous formal training or regular participation in tennis.
受试者：实验前没有参加过正规网球训练，并且也不经常参与网球运动的女大学生。

**Task:** Tennis forehand volley with the nondominant hand.
任务：用非优势手学习网球正手截击球。

**Practice procedures:** All participants first saw a brief instructional videotape that emphasized the basic elements of the volley.
练习流程：所有的受试者先观看一个简短的强调截击球基本动作要领的教学录像。

*Learning model group:* Participants practiced the volley for fifty trials; the instructor provided verbal feedback after each trial. Each student in this group had a student, who was not in this group, observe and listen to a videotape of her practice trials.
准示范者组（Learning model group）：受试者练习 50 次截击球；指导者在每次练习后均提供口头反馈。该组的每一位受试者均匹配了一位其他组的学习者看和听她的练习录像带。

*Observer groups:* After observing the learning models, participants were divided into two groups and began their own fifty trials of practice.
观察者组（Observer groups）：观察对应的准示范者的示范后，该组受试者进一步分为两组，并各自进行 50 次练习。

*Observer group with verbal feedback:* Participants in this group received verbal feedback from the instructor after each practice trial.
获得口头反馈的观察者组（Observer group with verbal feedback）：该组受试者在每次练习后均获得来自指导者的口头反馈。

*Observer group without verbal feedback:* Participants in this group did not receive verbal feedback from the instructor after each practice trial.
无口头反馈的观察者组（Observer group without verbal feedback）：该组受试者在每次练习后不会获得来自指导者的口头反馈。

*Control group:* Participants in this group practiced fifty trials of the volley without having observed the learning model participants or receiving verbal feedback from the instructor.
控制组：该组受试者练习 50 次截击球，但不观察准示范者组的录像，也不获得指导者的口头反馈。

**Results:**  On a posttest of the volley given after the practice trials, both observer groups performed better than the control group.
结果：练习后的截击球测试中，两个观察学习组的表现均好于控制组。

**Conclusion:** Having beginning tennis players observe other beginners practice a skill before they begin to practice will facilitate their learning of the skill.
结论：在练习前，让网球初学者观察其他初学者的练习，将有助于她们学习该技能。

An experiment by Hebert and Landin (1994) nicely illustrates how practitioners can facilitate skill acquisition for beginners by having them observe other beginners.
Hebert 和 Landin (1994) 的实验非常好地展示了指导者如何通过让初学者观察其他初学者来促进技能的习得。

**Ironic Effects in a Soccer Penalty Shooting Task: Focusing on Actions Players Want to Avoid**
**足球罚球任务中的适得其反效应:关注球员想要避免的动作**

If you’ve ever missed a basketball free throw, a golf putt, or penalty kick in rugby or football after explicitly telling yourself “don’t miss,” you may have been the victim of an *ironic* effect. These effects, which refer to the tendency to perform actions you are intentionally trying to avoid, have important implications for the content of instructions given to performers. Binsch, Oudejans, Bakker, and Savelsbergh (2010) showed that ironic effects during soccer penalty shooting are linked to the “quiet eye” phenomenon that was introduced in chapter 9. 
在篮球罚球、高尔夫推杆或足球的点球前明确告诉自己“别射偏了”，结果就射偏了——如果你有这种经历，那你可能是“*适得其反效应*（ironic effect）”的受害者。这一效应指的是人们有种执行他们明确想回避的动作的倾向。在给执行者下指令时有必要考虑到这一效应的深远影响。Binsch、Oudejans、Bakker 和 Savelsbergh （2010）的研究表明，足球罚球时的适得其反效应与第9章中介绍的“安静的眼睛（quiet eye）”现象有关。

***Participants:*** Thirty-two amateur male soccer players with an average of 12.6 years of playing experience.
***受试者：*** 32名业余男子足球运动员，平均有12.6年的比赛经验。

***Task:*** To kick a soccer ball at a screen that had a video clip of a soccer goal and a stationary goalie projected onto it. The goalie was either in the middle of the goal or 15 cm or 30 cm to the right or left of center. 
***任务：*** 受试者要向一块屏幕踢球，屏幕上播放着有足球球门和固定站位守门员的视频片段。守门员要么在球门中间，要么在中间左右15厘米或30厘米处。

***Instructions:*** (1) *Accurate* condition—shoot as accurately as possible; (2) *not-keeper* condition—shoot as accurately as possible and be careful not to shoot within reach of the keeper; (3) *open-space* condition—shoot as accurately as possible and be careful to shoot into the open space. Five shots were taken in each condition for a total of fifteen shots per player.
***指令：*** (1)*准确*（Accurate）——尽可能准确地射门；(2)*避开守门员*（not-keeper）——尽可能准确射门，注意不要射到守门员伸手可及的范围内；(3)*空地*（open-space）——尽可能准确地射门，尽量射到空地。每种指令下进行 5 次射门，每位受试者总计进行 15 次射门。

***Results:*** Fourteen of the thirty-two participants displayed ironic effects, which were deemed to have occurred if the player kicked the ball 10 cm closer to the goalie in the *not-keeper* condition than the *accurate* condition. On average, the players who displayed ironic effects kicked the ball 24.3 cm closer to the keeper in the *not-keeper* condition than the accurate condition and 24.6 cm closer to the keeper in the *not-keeper* condition than the *open-space* condition. 
***结果：*** 32名受试者中有14名表现出适得其反效应，判断标准是测量球和守门员的距离，如果在“*避开守门员*”指令下的距离比“*准确*”指令下的距离近 10 厘米以上，就认为出现了该效应。平均而言，表现出适得其反效应的球员在“*避开守门员*”指令下的球的位置相较于“*准确*”指令，距离守门员近了 24.3 厘米；“*避开守门员*”指令相比于“*空地*”指令则是近了 24.6 厘米。

In addition, when ironic effects were observed the average final visual fixation on the open goal space (M = 129 ms) in the *not-keeper* condition was significantly shorter than in the accurate (M = 224 ms) and the *open-space* conditions, respectively. In short, the instruction not to shoot within reach of the keeper seemed to subtly bias attention toward the keeper and away from the open goal space in those players who were susceptible to ironic effects.
此外，当观察到适得其反效应时，在*避开守门员*条件下，在开放球门区(M = 129 ms)上的平均最终视觉注视（average final visual fixation）显著短于“*准确*”条件(M = 224 ms)和：*空地*“条件。简而言之，”不要在守门员伸手可及的范围内射门“的指令似乎微妙地将容易出现适得其反效应的受试者的注意力从开放球门区转移到了守门员身上。

The take-home message is that instructions should focus on the actions that performers need to accomplish and *not* on the actions that performers should avoid. A focus on the latter could bias attention away from the critical information that needs to be processed.
总之要记住的是，指令应该关注执行者需要完成的行动，而不是执行者应该避免的行动。对后者的关注可能会使注意力偏离需要处理的关键信息。

**Training Anticipatory Skills in Tennis with an Implicit Instructional Strategy**
**在网球中使用隐式指导策路来训练预判技能**

An objective of tennis instruction is to enhance players’ capabilities to anticipate as early as pos-sible the direction of a ball hit by an opponent. This objective was at the heart of an experiment by Farrow and Abernethy (2002) in which they compared two training techniques designed to increase junior tennis players’ anticipation skills for returning serves. Both techniques were based on the hypothesis that the sources of information used by the skilled players to anticipate serve direction could be used to train less-skilled players. All participants experienced the following sequence of tests and training: *Pretest—Training (4 wks, 3 days/wk)—Posttest—Retention Test (32 days later).*
网球教学的一个目的就是增强学习者的预判能力，使其尽早地知道对手击球的方向。这一目的正是 Farrow 和 Abernethy (2002) 研究的核心，他们比较了两种用于提高大学三年级网球运动员回发球预判技能的训练技术。这两种技术都以熟练运动员用于预测发球方向的信息源可以用于训练低水平运动员的假设为基础。所有的受试者都经历了以下的测试和训练流程：*预测试-练习（4周，3天/周）-后测试-保持测试（32 天后）*。

**Tests and Training**
**测试和训练**

Participants watched videotapes of skilled players’ serves, which were from the receiver’s view. During the tests, their task was to indicate as quickly as possible whether the serve direction was to their forehand or backhand. On some trials they verbally indicated the direction, while on others they moved with their racquets in the direction. Tapes were edited and programmed to stop at one of five time periods before and after racquetball contact (i.e., temporal occlusion): T1—900 msec before ball contact (start of ball toss); T2—600 msec before ball contact (ball toss almost at zenith); T3—300 msec before ball contact (racquet at top of backswing); T4—at ball contact; T5—after follow-through. Each training session consisted of watching temporally occluded videotapes of various professional tennis players hitting serves and then physically practicing the return of 50 serves.
受试者从接球者的角度观看熟练运动员发球的录像。测试中，他们的任务是尽快地指出发球方向是指向他们的正手还是反手位置。在一些练习中，需要他们说出球的方向。录像带经过特殊的处理，并通过程序控制，在球拍触球前、后的 5 个时间点会停止播放：T1 ——触球前 900 毫秒（开始抛球）；T2——触球前 600 毫秒（抛球到最高点）；13——触球前 300 毫秒（球拍处于后摆最高位置）；T4 ——触球时；T5 ——随摆后。每次练习都包括：观察在时间上进行遮蔽的专业网球运动员不同发球动作的录像，之后实际练习接发球 50 次。

**Training Techniques**
**训练技术**

***Explicit instruction:*** Participants received specific instruction about the relationship between information sources in the server’s action and the direction of a serve. These sources were highlighted in instructional videos, verbal and written information, and verbal feedback provided during the physical practice trials.
**外显的指导**：受试者会获得关于发球者动作与发球方向之间关系的特别信息指导。以录像、言语、书面信息等形式强调这些信息源，并且在每次身体练习后提供口头反馈。

***Implicit instruction:*** Participants received no specific instruction about the relationship between information sources in the server’s action and the direction of a serve. They were told that their task was to estimate the speed of each serve seen on the videotape.
**内隐的指导**：受试者不会获得特别信息指导。只告知他们的任务是估计录像上每次发球的速度。

**Results**
**结果**

**Explicit rule information:** Before and after the four-week training period, participants were asked to write down all the rules, coaching tips, and strategies they thought were important for returning serves. After training, the explicit training group wrote an average of 2.5 rules, while the implicit training group wrote an average of 0.5 rule.
**外显规则信息**：在 4 周训练期的前和后，让受试者写下所有他们认为在回发球中重要的规则、训练暗示和策略。训练后，外显训练组平均写了 2.5 个规则，而内隐训练组平均写了 0.5 个规则。

**Serve direction prediction accuracy:** Overall, both training groups improved from the pretest to the posttest. But seven of the eight participants in the implicit training group improved prediction accuracy *at ball contact,* compared to three of eight in the explicit group.
**发球方向预测的准确性**：总体上，两组从预测试到练习后测试的准确性都有所提高。但是内隐训练组中的 7 名受试者在击球时的预判准确性均提高，而外显训练组只有 3 名受试者有所提高。

**Conclusion**
**结论**

Although the prediction accuracy differences between the two training conditions were relatively minor, their similarity is important. That the implicit training led to test performance that was similar to that of explicit training indicates that the anticipatory information required to predict serve direction can be learned without being consciously aware of the specific sources for the information. However, it is important to note two important characteristics of the implicit training condition:
尽管两种训练条件之间的预测准确性差异很微小，但两组之间的相似性更重要。内隐训练和外显训练导致相似的测试绩效，说明预测发球方向所需的预判信息可以在非意识知觉的层面上进行学习。然而，要注意内隐训练条件的两个重要特征：

\1.	The participants directed attention to the server and the serve on each videotape, because they had to estimate the speed of the serve.
1. 受试者将注意力指向录像带上的发球者和发球，因为他们必须去估计发球的速度。

\2.The training period involved a large number of trials of observing a variety of servers and serves that were temporally occluded at various times before and after each serve.
2. 训练期间大量观察了各种发球者的录像，录像中的发球者和球在每次发球前后的不同时间会被暂时遮挡住。

**Considerations for Experts When Giving Verbal Instructions to Novices**
**专家向初学者进行口授时应该注意的事项**

We generally assume that beginners should be taught by people who are highly skilled in the activity to be learned. However, highly skilled performers (i.e., experts) can have problems when they give verbal instructions to beginners. We might expect certain types of problems because of some of the differences between experts and novices that we considered in chapter 12. Two differences that are especially relevant are these:
我们通常认为初学者的指导者应该是该技能的高度熟练的执行者。然而，高度熟练的执行者（即专家）在向初学者进行口授时同样会遇到问题。我们可以猜到是某些类型的问题，因为我们在第 12 章中探讨过专家和初学者之间存在一些差异。与此最相关的两个差异是：

*Their knowledge structures about the skill.* Compared to those of novices, experts’ knowledge structures tend to be more conceptual and organized, with more interrelationship among the concepts. Novices, on the other hand, tend to have knowledge structures that involve more concrete and specific pieces of information, with few concepts and interrelationships among them.
*专家和初学者关于技能的知识结构不同。* 与初学者相比，专家的知识结构倾向于更概念化和结构化，概念之间的相互关系较多。相反，初学者倾向于具有更多具体和特定的信息，概念和概念间的相互关系较少。

*The attention demands required to perform the skill.* Novices need to direct conscious attention to more, and different, aspects of the performance of a skill than experts.
*执行技能的注意力需求。* 与熟练者相比，初学者需要将有意识地将注意指向技能的更多方面。

An experiment by Hinds, Patterson, and Pfeffer (2001) provides some evidence and insight about the problems experts can have providing instructions to novices. In this experiment, experts in the domain of electronics instructed novices about how to build an electronic circuit, which involved connecting wires in specific ways to make the electronic components for several different devices, such as a radio or motion detector. Results showed that the experts provided instruction that was too conceptual and included too few concrete details to guide the novices. Interestingly, the experts’ self-reported assessment of their teaching skill did not correlate well with the type of instructions they provided.
Hinds、Patterson 和 Pfeffer （2001）的实验针对专家向初学者进行口授时可能存在的问题，提供了一些证据和较深入的见解。在这个实验中，电学专家指导初学者搭建一个电路，目标是用特定的方法将导线连接到一起，最终制成某些仪器（如收音机、运动探测器）的配件。结果显示，专家引导初学者的口授过于概念化，鲜有具体细节。有趣的是，专家关于技能教授的自我评估与他们真正提供的指导并不匹配。

**Guidelines for Using Verbal Cues for Skill Instruction and Rehabilitation**
Cues should be short statements of one, two, or three words.
Cues should relate logically to the aspects of the skill to be prompted by the cues.
Cues can prompt a sequence of several movements.
Cues should be limited in number. Cue only the most critical elements of performing the skill.
Cues can be especially helpful for directing shifts of attention.
Cues are effective for prompting a distinct rhythmic structure for a sequence of movements.
Cues must be carefully timed so that they serve as prompts and do not interfere with performance.
Cues should initially be spoken by the performer.

**在技能教学和康复中使用口头提示的指导方针**
提示应该足够简短，只包含一个至三个词。
提示应该与其所提醒的技能部分之间存在逻辑关系。
提示可以用来提醒由多个动作组成的系列运动。
提示不宜过多，仅应用于技能中最关键的部分。
提示非常有助于指引注意力的转移。
提示可以有效地指示序列运动中不同的节奏结构。
提供提示应该注意时机，使其起到提醒的作用，而不干扰技能的执行。
提示在开始时应该由执行者自己说。
