**APPLICATION**

If you wanted to instruct someone about how to perform a skill, how would you do it? Probably, you would demonstrate the skill, verbally describe what to do, or use some combination of both approaches. But do you know enough about the effectiveness of these different means of communication to know which one to prefer or when to use each one or both?
如果你想指导别人执行一项技能，你会怎么做？你可能会示范那项技能、口头描述要完成的任务，亦或两种方式兼用。但是，你真的了解这些不同教学方式的有效性吗？你了解哪种方式更好，或者这些方式何时应该单独使用而何时又该联合使用吗？

Demonstrating skills is undoubtedly the most common means of communicating how to perform them. We find demonstrations in a wide range of skill acquisition situations. For example, a physical education teacher may demonstrate to a large class how to putt in golf. A dance teacher may demonstrate to a class how to perform a particular sequence of movements. A baseball coach may show a player the correct form for bunting a ball. In a rehabilitation context, an occupational therapist may demonstrate to a patient how to button a shirt, or a physical therapist may demonstrate to a wheelchair patient how to get from a bed into the chair. Consider also some examples of how practitioners in other professions use demonstration as an instructional strategy. Aerobics and fitness instructors often demonstrate to their clients how to perform specific activities. Pilates and yoga instructors show their clients how to perform specific movements. And athletic trainers commonly demonstrate taping techniques to student trainers.
毫无疑问，示范技能是最常见的技能教学方式。示范被广泛地用于各类技能的习得。例如，体育老师可能会向学生示范如何轻击高尔夫球入洞；舞蹈老师可能向全班同学示范如何完成一系列特定的动作；棒球教练可能会向运动员示范击短打的正确方法。在康复情景中，职业治疗师可能会向患者示范如何扣衬衫上的扣子；物理治疗师可能会向轮椅上的患者示范如何从床上挪到轮椅上。其他行业的从业人员也可能会将示范作为他们的一种教学策略，比如健身教练会经常向他们的客户示范如何执行特定的活动；瑜伽教练也会向他们的客户示范如何完成特定的动作；运动防护员（athletic trainers）也常向学生示范如何用弹性带辅助练习（taping techniques）。

The practitioner demonstrates a skill because he or she believes that in this way the learner receives the most helpful, and the greatest amount of, information in the least amount of time. But, we should know when demonstration is effective and when it may be less effective than some other means of communicating how to perform a skill.
这些从业人员之所以示范，是因为他们相信通过这种方式，学习者可以在最短的时间内获得最多的有用信息。但是，我们应该明确何时示范最有效、何时其他教学方式更有效。

Similarly, the instructor should know when verbal instructions are an effective means of communicating how to perform a skill. And if verbal instructions are given, what characterizes the most effective instructions?
同样，教师也要明白何时应该使用“口授”这种教学方法，以及如何高效地进行口授。

**DISCUSSION**

It is ironic that although demonstration is a very common method of providing information about how to perform a skill, there is not as much research related to it as we might expect. However, in recent years researchers have shown an increased interest in the role of demonstration in motor skill learning.
虽然示范是一种非常普及的指导技能执行的方法，但与此相关的研究并没有预期的那么多。不过近年来已有越来越多的研究者开始关注示范在运动技能学习中的作用。 

There seem to be at least two reasons for the increased interest in demonstration and skill learning. One reason is the phenomenal growth of interest in the role of vision in skill learning. Because demonstrating how to do a skill typically involves visual observation on the part of the learner, researchers have been able to use the study of demonstration and skill learning to assess how the visual system is involved in skill acquisition and performance. Another reason for the current interest is that we know so little about how to effectively implement this very common instructional strategy. As a result, researchers have been making an increased effort to improve our understanding of the role of demonstration in skill instruction and learning.
引起关注增加的原因至少有两个：一是因为视觉在技能学习中的作用引起了研究者的兴趣，而学习者在观察示范动作时通常有视觉的参与，所以研究人员可以通过对示范和技能学习的研究来探究视觉系统如何影响技能习得与技能表现；二是，我们对如何有效地进行示范知之甚少。因此，研究人员一直在努力增进我们对示范在技能教学和学习中的作用的理解。

**DEMONSTRATION**

The terms **modeling** and **observational learning** often are used interchangeably with the term *demonstration.* Because *demonstration* is more specific to the context of instruction about how to perform a skill, we will use this term in this text.
与*示范（demonstration）* 等价的术语一般还有 **展示（modeling）** 和 **观察学习（observational learning）**。但考虑到*示范*一词更加适用于技能教学情景，本章中将主要使用这一术语。

In comprehensive reviews of research investigating the role of demonstration in motor skill acquisition, McCullagh and Weiss (2001) and McCullagh, Law, and Ste-Marie (2012) discussed evidence that indicates demonstration is more effective under certain circumstances than under others. And in an article that reviewed research concerning instruction of sports skills, Williams and Hodges (2005) questioned many popular beliefs that influenced practice and instruction in the coaching of soccer. One of the beliefs they questioned, which the researchers listed as “myths,” was “Myth 1: Demonstrations are always effective in conveying information to the learner” (p. 640). Thus reviews of research related to the effectiveness of demonstrations as an instructional strategy concluded that the practitioner should use demonstration only after determining that the instructional situation indeed warrants the use of demonstration, rather than some other form of providing information about skill performance. In the following sections, we consider some of the concerns that practitioners need to take into account before making this instructional decision.
McCullagh 和 Weiss (2001) 和 McCullagh、Law 和 Ste-Marie (2012) 在相关的全面综述中指出在某些情况下示范比其他教学方式更有效。而 Williams 和 Hodges (2005) 在一篇关于运动技能教学的研究综述中，对足球教学界的一些流行观念提出了质疑，文章中质疑的一个观念（他们称之为“神话”）是“神话1：示范总能有效地向学习者传递信息”(第640页)。从这些相关综述可以看出，教师只有先明确示范教学法的适用范围，才能有效地使用该方法。下文我们就将讨论一些从业人员在确定示范教学法的适用范围时需要注意的问题。

**What the Observer Perceives from a Demonstration**
**观察者从示范中获得了什么信息**

The decision about the situations in which demonstration would be preferred should be based on our knowledge of what a person actually “sees” when a skill is demonstrated. Note the use of the word “sees” rather than “looks at.” What we see and what we look at can be very different. What we “see” is what we *perceive* from what we look at. This distinction is particularly relevant to the discussion of demonstration, because what a person perceives from a skill demonstration is not necessarily something that he or she specifically looks at or looks for. It is also important to keep in mind that what we perceive may be at a conscious or nonconscious level of awareness. For example, when people are asked later to describe verbally what they saw in a demonstration that helped them perform a skill, they do not always give a very accurate accounting.
确定示范教学法的适用范围应该以个体从示范中实际“了解到（see）”了什么。注意这里使用的是“了解到（see）”而不是“看到（looks at）”，因为我们所看到的和我们所了解到的内容可能会非常不同：我们“了解到”的是我们从看到的景象中“感知”到的东西。这一区别和示范密切相关，因为个体从示范中感知到的信息未必是他正在看或者特别去看的东西。此外很重要的是，感知可能是有意识的，也可能是无意识的。比如，在示范结束后让学习者描述在示范中获得了哪些有用的信息，他们并不一定能给出准确的描述。

Research evidence has shown consistently that the observer perceives from the demonstration information about the coordination pattern of the skill (e.g., Ashford, Bennett, & Davids, 2006; Horn & Williams, 2004). More specifically, *the observer perceives and uses the invariant relative motions that characterize the coordinated movement pattern* to develop his or her own movement pattern to perform the skill.
研究证据一致表明，观察者从示范中获得的是关于技能协调模式的信息(可参见 Ashford, Bennett, & Davids, 2006; Horn & Williams, 2004)。具体地说，观察者感知并使用协调运动模式中不变的相对运动关系来发展和形成自己的技能执行的动作模式。 

Two types of research evidence support this view. One involves the investigation of the visual perception of motion; the other is the investigation of the influence of demonstration on learning a complex skill. Taken together, these two types of research indicate that the visual system automatically detects in a movement pattern invariant information for determining how to produce the observed action. In some manner, which scientists do not fully understand and continue to debate, the person translates the perceived information into movement commands to produce the action.
有两类研究证据支持这一观点：一类来自于对运动的视觉感知的研究；另一类来自于示范对学习复杂技能的影响的研究。这些研究共同表明，视觉系统自动觉察运动模式中的不变信息，以确定如何执行观察到的动作。研究人员尚未完全理解并产生争议的问题是个体如何将感知到的信息转化为动作指令以执行动作。

**The Visual Perception of Motion**
**运动的视觉感知**

Research investigating the perception of human motion attempts to answer questions about how people recognize movement patterns they see in their world. An important principle developed from this research is that people rarely use specific characteristics of the individual components of a pattern to make judgments about the pattern. Rather, they use relative information about the relationships among the various components.
对人体运动感知的研究旨在回答个体如何辨认看到的运动模式。从这些研究中得到的一个共同规律是：个体几乎不使用运动模式中某个部分的特定特征来判断运动模式；相反，他们做出判断依靠的是各组成部分之间的相对关系的信息。

Using a procedure known as the **point-light technique,** researchers have identified the relative information involved in the visual perception of human movement. 
通过所谓的**标记点技术（point-light technique）**，研究人员已经发现了与个体运动视觉感知有关的相对信息。
This procedure involves placing lights or light-reflecting markers on the joints of a person who is then filmed or videotaped performing an action or skill. 
这一技术是先在个体的关节上放置光点或反光标记，然后拍摄该个体执行技能的过程。
Then the researcher plays the film or video so that the person who watches the film or video sees only bright dots in motion. 
然后，研究人员放映录像，观看者只能看到关节上的光点的移动。
The first reported use of this procedure (Johansson, 1973) showed that people could accurately label different gait patterns, such as walking and running, by observing the moving dot patterns. 
Johansson (1973) 首次使用该技术进行了研究，该研究显示被试者通过观察光点的移动模式，能够准确地辨认不同的步态，如走和跑。
Later, Cutting and Kozlowski (1977) showed that from observing moving dot patterns, people actually could identify their friends. 
随后，Cutting 和 Kozlowski 的研究 (1977) 显示，被试者可以仅通过观察光点的移动模式来分辨他们的朋友。
In addition, Abernethy and Zawi (2007) have shown that expert badminton players could predict the direction of an opponent’s strokes in advance of racquet-shuttlecock contact just as well when they viewed full-body videos or point-light displays. 
此外，Abernethy 和 Zawi (2007)的研究表明，无论是看全身运动视频还是看光点演示视频，专业羽毛球运动员都能在球拍和羽毛球接触之前预测对手击球的方向。
An impressive amount of research has shown that observers are able to detect a range of different movements and a range of different movement characteristics based on point-light displays. (For a review of this research see Blake & Shiffar, 2007.) 
除了这些，还有大量研究表明观察者能够通过光点演示视频识别出一系列不同的运动和运动特征。(这些研究的综述可参见 Blake & Shiffar, 2007。)

Using a computer simulation, Hoenkamp (1978) showed that the movement characteristic people use to identify different gait patterns is not any one kinematic variable, but the *ratio of the time duration between the forward and return swings of the lower leg.*
使用计算机模拟技术，Hoenkamp (1978) 指出个体并不是依据运动学变量来识别不同的步态模式，而是根据*小腿前、后摆动持续时间短比率*。

This groundbreaking research on the perception of human movement provided two important conclusions that help our understanding of observational learning. First, people can recognize different gait patterns accurately and quickly without seeing the entire body or all the limbs move. Second, the most critical information people perceive in order to distinguish one type of gait pattern from another is not any one characteristic of the gait, such as velocity of the limbs. Instead, people use the invariant relative time relationship between two components of gait. The question that naturally arises, then, is if people use relative motion information to recognize movement patterns, is the provision of this source of information in a demonstration the most effective way to bring about changes in coordination? 
这项突破性的研究为我们理解观察学习提供了两个重要结论：首先，个体可以在不看全身或肢体运动的情况下识别出不同的步态模式；其次，个体用于区分不同步态模式的最关键信息并不是步态的某个具体特征（如肢体移动速度等），而是步态模式的组成成分之间的不变相对时间关系。那么，一个自然的问题是，如果个体使用相对运动信息来识别运动模式，那么在示范中提供这种信息源是改变协调模式的最有效方式吗？

**What Movement Characteristics Change When Learners View a Skilled Demonstration?**
**技能示范改变了观察者的哪些运动特征**

Having established that perceivers use relative motions to distinguish different patterns of movement, one would expect to see that the learners’ pattern of relative motions changes after they have viewed a skilled demonstration. 
既然已经确定观察者使用相对运动来区分不同的运动模式，人们自然会猜测学习者的相对运动模式在观看技能熟练者进行的示范后会发生变化。
An experiment by Schoenfelder-Zohdi (1992), in which subjects practiced the slalom ski simulator task shown in figure 14.2, supports this expectation. 
Schoenfelder-Zohdi (1992) 利用障碍滑雪模拟器（如图14.2所示）进行的实验支持了上述猜测。
This simulator consisted of two rigid, convex, parallel tracks on which a movable platform stood. 
在这项实验中，被试者要练习在障碍滑雪模拟器上练习完成任务。这种模拟器由两个向上凸起的刚性平行轨道组成，轨道上还有一个可移动的平台供被试者站立。
A participant stood on the platform with both feet and was required to move the platform to the right and then to the left as far as possible (55 cm to either side) with rhythmic slalom ski–like movements. 
被试者双脚站上平台后就被要求将平台移动到右侧，随后再像障碍滑雪运动那样有节奏地将平台移动到左侧（两侧之间的距离为55厘米）。
The platform was connected on either side to each end of the apparatus by strong, springlike rubber bands, which ensured that the platform always returned to the center (normal) position. 
平台两侧通过坚固且有弹性的橡胶带与轨道两端连接，以保证平台总会回到中央位置（正常位置）。
Thus, the participant had to learn to control the platform movement by using smooth ski-like movements, just as he or she would if actually skiing. 
这样，被试者就必须学习通过运用与障碍滑雪类似的动作来控制平台的运动。
Participants practiced this skill for several days after they had either observed a skilled model perform the task or received verbal information about the goal of the task. 
实验中被试都会在观看技能熟练者的示范或接受关于任务目标的口头指导后练习该任务数天。
A kinematic analysis of limb movements showed that participants who had observed the skilled demonstration developed coordinated movement patterns earlier in practice than did those who had not observed the demonstration.
肢体运动的运动学分析表明于未观察示范的被试者相比，观察技能熟练者示范的被试者能在练习中更早地形成协调的运动模式。
Figure 14.3 shows one example of these results. Moreover, in a meta-analysis of 64 studies involving a variety of motor skills, Ashford, Davids, and Bennett (2006) showed that demonstrations convey relative motions required to approximate modeled movement behaviors. 
图14.3展示了该结果的一个例子。此外，在对涉及各种运动技能的64项研究的元分析中，Ashford、Davids 和 Bennett (2006)指出，观察者可以从示范中获得模仿该运动所需要的相对运动信息。
Research has also shown that the observation of full-body demonstrations are not necessary to bring about changes in movement coordination. 
研究人员还发现，观察全身示范并不一定会带来运动协调模式的变化。
For example, Horn, Scott, Williams, and Hodges (2005) showed equivalent changes in the pattern of relative motions underlying a soccer chipping skill when learners watched a video display or a point-light display of a skilled performer.
举例来说，Horn、Scott、Williams 和 Hodges (2005)发现无论学习者是观看技能熟练者的示范视频还是标记点演示视频，他们在足球削球技能上的相对运动模式的改变是相同的。

Although changes in coordination have been documented following the observation of full-body video demonstrations and point-light displays, learners do not necessarily need to see a model’s relative motions to reproduce them. 
尽管有许多文献记述了观看全身示范视频和标记点演示视频对协调模式的改变，但是要复现示范者的相对运动模式，学习者不一定需要实际看到这些相对运动模式。
Support for this notion has been provided in an experiment by Hodges, Hayes, Breslin, and Williams (2005) in which participants learned a novel kicking motion that was used by a well-practiced player to “scoop” a soccer ball over a barrier and onto a target. 
Hodges、Hayes、Breslin和Williams (2005)的实验为这一观点提供了支持，在该实验中，被试者要学习一种新颖的踢球动作，一名训练有素的球员会使用这种动作将足球“铲”过障碍物并踢向目标。
The participants were shown a point-light display of either the knee, ankle, and toe during the kicking task (Leg), just the ankle and foot (Foot), or only the toe (Toe). 
被试者被分为三组，分别观看不同的标记点演示录像：腿部组可以看到示范过程中膝盖、脚踝和脚趾的标记点；足部组可以看到脚踝和足部的标记点；脚趾组只能看到脚趾的标记点。
Results indicated that the group receiving only the information about the toe more closely matched the pattern of hip-knee coordination used by the model than the groups receiving the additional information. 
结果表明，仅接受脚趾信息的脚趾组比其他接受额外信息的组更接近于示范者使用的髋-膝协调模式。
The superiority of the Toe group was seen when the learners practiced the kicking motion after the demonstration, when they practiced again after receiving a full-body point-light display of the kicking motion, and when they actually kicked the ball over the barrier toward the target. 
在观察完示范后的练习中、在观看全身标记点演示视频后的再次练习中以及在在实际将球踢过障碍抵达目标的测试中，脚趾组都体现出了优势。
Interestingly, larger changes in knee-ankle coordination in the Leg and Foot groups were seen when the learners had to kick the ball than when they were shown the full-body demonstration. 
值得关注的是，腿部组和足部组在实际踢球时，髋-膝协调模式上的变化比看了全身演示后的变化更大。
In other words, the constraint imposed by the ball had a greater influence on the acquisition of the coordination pattern than did viewing the pattern of relative motions of the well-practiced player’s whole body.
换言之，足球这一约束相比于观看一个技能熟练者的全身相对运动模式的示范，对协调模式的习得产生的影响更大。【】

The findings reported by Hodges et al. (2005) are consistent with Latash and Turvey’s (1996) claim that people are generally concerned about controlling the distal point of the limb during the execution of everyday movements. 
Hodges 等人(2005)的发现与 Latash 和 Turvey (1996)的主张一致，即人们在执行日常动作的时候通常关心如何控制肢体的远端点。
Hodges, Williams, Hayes, and Breslin (2007) have provided additional examples of coordination changes induced by observing the motions of end effectors and, consistent with the *action effect* and *constrained action* hypotheses introduced in chapter 9, have also suggested that demonstrating movement effects (e.g., the trajectory of a ball) might be as effective in inducing coordination changes as providing end-point information in a demonstration. 
Hodges、Williams、Hayes 和 Breslin (2007)还提出了例子，表明观察末端效应器的运动可以引起的协调模式的变化。他们的研究还表明，提供运动结果信息（如球的轨迹）在带来协调模式的改变方面和在示范中提供远端点信息一样有效，这一结果与第9章中介绍的*动作效应【】* 和 *约束动作【】* 假设一致
Hodges et al. (2007) also note, however, that modeling end-point information is not always more effective than modeling relative motion information in facilitating the acquisition of new patterns of coordination. Rather, the effects seem to be task specific and potentially also specific to the learner’s skill level. 
不过 Hodges 等人(2007)也指出，在促进新的协调模式的习得方面，提供远端点信息并不总是比提供相对运动信息更有效。
Clearly, more research is needed to resolve exactly what sources of invariant information should be provided to learners and when they should be provided during the learning process. 
显然，需要更多的研究来确定在学习过程中应该向学习者提供什么样的以及何时提供不变信息源。
In the meantime, practitioners should be aware that it is important to consider potential differences in how movement is perceived (recognized) versus how it is controlled, particularly during the early stages of skill acquisition, when determining the most appropriate information to provide to learners in a demonstration.
与此同时，从业人员应该意识到，在确定向学习者提供最合适的示范信息时，注意到感知(识别)运动与控制运动的潜在差异是很重要的，尤其是在技能习得的早期阶段。

**The Influence of Skill Characteristics**
**技能特征的影响**

Research has produced equivocal findings about the effectiveness of demonstrations for learning new skills. Some researchers have found that demonstration leads to better skill learning than other forms of instruction; others have found that it does not. But as Magill and Schoenfelder-Zohdi (1996) pointed out, a closer inspection of that research leads to the conclusion that the influence of demonstration on skill acquisition depends on characteristics of the skill being learned. The most important characteristic that determines whether a demonstration will be beneficial is whether the skill being learned requires the *acquisition of a new pattern of coordination.*
众多关于示范对学习效果影响的研究并未得出一致的结论。一些研究者发现，与其他形式的指导相比，示范更有利于技能学习，而另一些研究者则认为并非如此。但是，正如 Magill 和 Schoenfelder-Zohdi （1996）所指出的，对这些研究进行更细致的分析后会发现，示范对技能习得的影响取决于所学技能的特征。决定示范是否有益的最重要的特征是正在学习的技能是否要求*获得一种新的协调运动模式*。

We see this clearly when we organize into two categories the results of research investigating the effect of demonstration on skill learning. In one category are those experiments in which participants learned more quickly after demonstration than after other forms of instruction. In experiments in this category, participants typically learned skills requiring them to acquire new patterns of limb coordination. In the other category are experiments in which participants usually learned skills no better after observing demonstrations than after receiving other forms of instruction. In these experiments, the participants practiced skills that required them to acquire new parameter characteristics for well-learned patterns of limb coordination.
将示范对技能学习影响的研究结果分为两类之后，我们更清楚地认识到了这一点。其中一类结果是，与其他指导形式相比，观察示范能加快受试者的学习速度。这一类的实验中，学习任务通常要求受试者习得新的肢体协调模式。另外一类结果则显示，观察示范相比与其他的指导形式，并未使得受试者表现出更好的学习效果。在这一类的实验中，学习任务要求受试者调整已经习得的肢体协调模式的参数。
**The Neural Basis for Observational Learning: Mirror Neurons in the Brain**
**观察学习的神经基础：脑中的镜像神经元**

In the early 1990s, neuroscientists in Italy, led by Giacomo Rizzolatti, discovered that when monkeys observed another monkey reach out its arm to grasp something, neurons in the F5 area of their premotor cortex became active (see Miller, 2005; Rizzolatti & Craighero, 2004). These neurons, known as *mirror neurons*, are a specific class of visuomotor neurons in the brain. The important question for understanding the neural basis for observation learning by humans is this: Does the human brain contain mirror neurons? Several studies have provided evidence that supports mirrorlike neurons in the human brain.
20世纪90年代初，由 Giacomo Rizzolatti 领导的一组意大利神经科学家发现，当猴子观察到另一只猴子伸出手臂抓东西时，它们前运动皮层F5区的神经元会变得活跃(参见 Miller, 2005; Rizzolatti & Craighero, 2004)。这些神经元被称为*镜像神经元（mirror neurons）*，是大脑中一类特殊的视觉运动神经元。对于理解人类观察学习的神经基础来说，一个重要问题是：人类的大脑包含镜像神经元吗？一些研究提供了证据，支持人脑中存在类镜像神经元（mirrorlike neurons）。

In an early study, a group of neuroscientists in Los Angeles, California, pooled data from seven fMRI studies in which people observed and imitated simple finger movements (Molnar-Szakacs, Iacoboni, Koski, & Mazziotta, 2005). The researchers noted that during observation, specific areas activated in the *inferior frontal gyrus* *(IFG),* which is in the inferior frontal lobe of the cerebral cortex. Two sections of the IFG activated during observation (the pars triangularis and the dorsal section of the pars opercularis) but not during the movement imitation. Subsequent research by Catmur, Walsh, and Heyes (2009) showed that theta-burst transcranial magnetic stimulation of the IFG disrupts automatic imitation of finger movements. Interestingly, the IFG includes the region of the brain known as Broca’s 
area, which is important in speech production.
在一项早期研究中，洛杉矶的一组神经科学家汇整了七项 fMRI 研究的数据，这些研究要求人类受试者观察并模仿简单的手指运动（Molnar-Szakacs, Iacoboni, Koski, & Mazziotta, 2005）。研究人员注意到，在观察过程中，大脑皮层下额叶的*下额回（inferior frontal gyrus, IFG）* 中的特定区域被激活。IFG 中的两个部分在观察动作时被激活(三角部和鳃盖部的背侧部分)，但在模仿动作时不被激活。Catmur，Walsh 和 Heyes （2009）的后续研究表明，IFG 的 θ-突发经颅磁刺激干扰了手指运动的自动模仿。值得注意的是，IFG 包括了大脑中所谓的布洛卡区，这一区域在言语功能中发挥了重要功能。

Researchers in Germany (Zentgraf et al., 2005) used fMRI to assess brain activity during the observation of whole-body gymnastics movements. Their results showed that when participants were asked to observe with the intent to imagine themselves imitating the movements, activation was recorded in the *supplementary motor area* *(SMA)* of the cortex. Interestingly, when the participants were asked to observe the movements with the intent to judge their accuracy and consistency, the pre-SMA area activated. Other fMRI research has found mirrorlike neuron activity in the *parietal cortex,* which is involved in interhemispheric visuomotor integration (Iacoboni & Zaidel, 2004), and *lateral temporal cortex,* which is involved in processing complex visual motion (Beauchamp, Lee, Haxby, & Martin, 2003). In addition to using fMRI, researchers have also used EEG recordings to provide evidence of the involvement of a mirror neuron system during action observation (e.g., Calmels, Hars, Holmes, Jarry, & Stam, 2008; Denis, Rowe, Williams, & Milne, 2017). 
德国的研究人员（Zentgraf et al., 2005）以观察全身体操动作的过程为研究对象，使用 fMRI 来评估大脑活动。他们的结果表明，当受试者被要求在观察的同时想象自己模仿这些动作时，会激活大脑皮层的*补充运动区（supplementary motor area, SMA）*。但是，当受试者被要求观察动作并判断其准确性和一致性时，会激活前SMA区域。其他 fMRI 研究发现，在*顶叶皮层（parietal cortex）* 和 *侧颞叶皮层（lateral temporal cortex）* 中存在类镜像神经元活动，前者参与半球间视觉运动整合（Iacoboni & Zaidel, 2004），后者参与处理复杂的视觉运动（Beauchamp, Lee, Haxby, & Martin, 2003）。除了使用 fMRI，研究人员还使用 EEG 记录来提供动作观察期间有某个镜像神经元系统的参与的证据（例如，Calmels, Hars, Holmes, Jarry, & Stam, 2008; Denis, Rowe, Williams, & Milne, 2017）。

Taken together, these brain activity recording methods indicate the existence of a mirror neuron system, although many questions remain unresolved concerning its specific characteristics and functions. (For a more complete review of research on the mirror neuron system and its implications for physical rehabilitation, see Iacoboni & Mazziotta, 2007.) 
总之，上述这些脑活动记录表明了某个镜像神经元系统的存在，虽然关于其具体特征和功能的许多问题仍未解决。(关于镜像神经元系统的研究及其对身体康复的影响的完整综述，见 Iacoboni & Mazziotta, 2007。)

It is important to keep in mind that the areas of the brain that contain mirror neurons are not the only areas of the brain that might contribute to the motor learning effects associated with action observation. For example, Jeannerod’s (2001) *simulation theory* proposed that the same brain regions were recruited during action observation, motor imagery, and movement execution. These regions were thought to include the prefrontal, premotor, primary motor, and parietal cortices, and the basal ganglia and cerebellum. Recruitment of these areas during action observation was presumed to be the basis for improvements in motor learning that follow from watching others perform motor skills. More recent analyses have shown that despite similarities in the brain regions recruited during action observation and movement execution, distinct differences also exist. For example, in a meta analysis that included 595 action observation experiments and 142 movement execution experiments, Hardwick, Caspers, Eickhoff, and Swinnen (2018) showed that observing and executing simple movements of the arms, legs, and face consistently recruited similar premotor and parietal cortical networks. However, less than half of the premotor-parietal network for movement execution was also involved in action observation. Moreover, action observation did not recruit sub-cortical structures, like the basal ganglia, or the cerebellum, which consistently participate in movement execution. These findings suggest that previous researchers have overestimated the similarities in the brain networks involved in observing and executing movements, and they raise interesting questions about the neural contributions that action observation makes to motor learning.
需要注意的是，包含镜像神经元的区域并不是大脑中唯一可能与观察学习有关的区域。例如，Jeannerod （2001）的*模拟理论（simulation theory）* 提出，在动作观察、运动想象和运动执行过程中，有相同的大脑区域参与了这些过程。这些区域包括前额叶、运动前区、初级运动区、顶叶皮质、基底神经节和小脑。在动作观察过程中这些区域的参与被认为是在观察他人示范运动技能后自身运动水平得到改善的基础。而最近的分析表明，尽管在动作观察和动作执行过程中参与的大脑区域有相似之处，但也存在明显的差异。例如，在一项包括595个动作观察实验和142个动作执行实验的元分析中，Hardwick,、Caspers、Eickhoff 和 Swinnen 提出，尽管相似的前运动皮层和顶叶皮层网络参与了动作观察和手臂、腿和面部的简单动作执行。然而，总的来看，参与动作执行的前运动-顶叶网络中，同样参与了动作观察只有不到一半。此外，像基底神经节或小脑这样持续参与动作执行过程的皮质下结构并没有参与动作观察过程。这些发现表明，以前的研究人员高估了参与动作观察和运动执行的大脑网络的相似性。这也引出了一个值得关注的问题，即动作观察对运动学习的神经贡献。

**Observing Skilled Demonstrations**
**观察技能熟练者的示范**

A common guiding principle for demonstrating a skill is that the demonstrator should perform the skill correctly. Why would more accurate demonstration lead to better learning? Two reasons are evident from the research literature. The first reason follows our discussion of perception of information in the preceding section. If the observer perceives and uses information related to invariant movement patterns, it is logical to expect the quality of performance resulting from observing a demonstration to be related to the quality of the demonstration. Another reason is that in addition to picking up coordination information, an observer also perceives information about the strategy used by the model to solve the movement problem. Typically, the observer then tries to imitate that strategy on his or her initial attempts at performing the skill.
应该进行正确的示范，这是人们的普遍认识。为什么准确的示范会带来更好的学习效果？从研究文献中可以得出两方面原因。第一个原因与我们在前一节中对信息感知的讨论有关。如果观察者感知并使用与不变运动模式相关的信息，那么一个很合理的想法就是示范质量越高，由此带来的表现质量也就越高。另一个原因是，除了获得协调信息之外，观察者还会感知示范者用来解决运动问题的策略。一般而言，观察者在最初尝试执行技能时会试图模仿他们观察到策略。

**Novices Observing Other Novices Practice**
**新手观察其他新手**

Although the theoretical predictions and the empirical evidence indicate that it is preferable for beginners to observe skilled demonstrators, evidence indicates that beginners can derive learning benefits even from observing unskilled demonstrators, especially if both the observers and the models are beginners. What this means is that the models are “demonstrators” only in that the observers are watching them practice.
尽管理论预测和经验表明初学者最好观察熟练的示范者，但证据表明初学者也可以从观察不熟练的示范者中获得学习益处，特别是当观察者和示范者都是初学者，即示范者之所以称为“示范者”仅因为有观察者在观察他们练习。

One proposed benefit of using demonstration in this way is that it discourages imitation of a skilled model’s performance of the skill and encourages the observer to engage in more active problem solving to determine the most effective movements to achieve the action goal of the skill. We can trace evidence for the benefit of this approach to the 1930s (e.g., Twitmeyer, 1931), although widespread interest in this approach did not develop until Adams (1986) published some experiments. Since then, others have pursued the investigation of the use and benefit of observing an unskilled model (e.g., McCullagh & Meyer, 1997; Pollock & Lee, 1992; Ste-Marie, Law, Rymal, O, Hall, & McCullagh, 2012; Weir & Leavitt, 1990). This research has consistently shown that beginners who observe other beginners practicing a skill will perform at a higher level when they begin to perform than the beginners they observed.
这种方式进行示范的一个好处是会防止观察者盲目模仿技能熟练的示范者的技能表现，并鼓励观察者更主动的参与解决问题的过程，以确定实现技能的动作目标的最有效的方式。对这种方法的好处的研究可以追溯到20世纪30年代（如 Twitmeyer, 1931），不管直到 Adams （1986）发表了相关实验后，人们才对这种方法产生了广泛的兴趣。从那以后，其他人开始研究观察非熟练示范者的用途和益处（例如，McCullagh & Meyer, 1997; Pollock & Lee, 1992; Ste-Marie, Law, Rymal, O, Hall, & McCullagh, 2012; Weir & Leavitt, 1990）。这些研究一致表明，观察其他初学者练习技能的初学者，在他们开始练习时，会比他们的观察对象表现得更好。

One way to effectively implement this use of demonstration is by pairing students, athletes, or patients in situations where one of the pair performs the skill while the other observes. After a certain number of trials or amount of time, the pair switches roles. On the basis of what we know from the research literature, learning of the skill can be facilitated for both the performer and the observer by having the teacher, coach, therapist, or some other knowledgeable person provide verbal feedback to the performer. Another effective strategy is to provide the observer of the pair with a checklist of key aspects of the skill. The observer should look for each aspect, check it on the list, and then provide some feedback to the performer. Under these conditions, the observer actively engages in problem-solving activity that is beneficial for learning. The learner observes what the unskilled model does, what the “expert” tells him or her is wrong with the attempt, what the model does to correct errors, and how successful he or she is on the succeeding attempts. Wulf, Shea, and Lewthwaite (2010) provide a good discussion of how this type of dyad practice can be used to enhance medical education. 
有效实施这一技术的一种方法是将学生、运动员或病人两两配对。组内其中一人执行技能，另一人则观察，经过一定时间或一定次数的练习后，两人交换角色。此外，根据我们从研究文献中了解到的情况，通过让老师、教练、治疗师等专家向执行者提供口头反馈，执行者和观察者都可以更容易地学习技能。因此，另一个有效的策略是向组内的观察者提供一份列出了技能关键环节的清单。观察者应该在执行者执行技能的同时寻找这些环节，在清单上打勾，然后向执行者提供反馈。在这个情景中，观察者积极地参与到有利于学习的解决问题的活动中。通过这个方法，学习者能够观察不熟练的执行者的表现情况，得到“专家”告知的在执行过程中的错误，观察执行者纠正错误的方法以及在接下来的执行中的表现情况。之后，Wulf、Shea 和 Lewthwaite （2010）还讨论了如何将这类的二人练习方式用于加强医学教育。

Another way to have a novice observe a novice is to use *self-observation* via video replay, a technique that can also be classified as video feedback because learners watch themselves perform a task rather than another person (Anderson, Rymal, & Ste-Marie, 2014). Researchers have shown that this type of observational practice, which is always done alongside physical practice, can be particularly effective if it is combined with observation of a skilled performer demonstrating the task (Robinson, St. Germain, & Ste-Marie, 2018).
让新手观察新手的另一种技术是通过视频回放进行*自我观察（self-observation）*。这种技术也可以归类为视频反馈，因为学习者是在观看自己而不是另一个人执行任务（Anderson, Rymal, & Ste-Marie, 2014）。研究表明，这种常与物理练习一起进行的观察练习如果与观察技能熟练者的演示相结合，可能会特别有效（Robinson, St. Germain, & Ste-Marie, 2018）。

**The Timing and Frequency of Demonstrating a Skill**
**技能示范的时机与频率**

One of the reasons for demonstrating a skill is to communicate how to perform the skill. For the beginner, demonstration provides an effective means of communicating the general movement pattern of the action or skill. As we discussed in chapter 12, Gentile considered this to be the goal of the first stage of learning. When applied to the use of demonstration, Gentile’s view suggests two things. The first is that it is beneficial to demonstrate a skill *before the person begins practicing it.* The second is that the instructor should *continue demonstrating during practice as frequently as necessary.*
进行技能示范的一个原因是为了传递执行技能的方式。对于初学者来说，示范是有效传递动作或技能的一般运动模式的一种手段。正如第12章中所讨论的，Gentile 认为这是学习第一阶段的目标。从 Gentile 理论的角度来看示范的使用时机和频率，可以得到两点启示：首先，在开始练习一项技能之前进行示范是有益的；其次，*在练习中指导者应该尽可能频繁地进行示范*。

Earlier, we pointed out that a skilled demonstration communicates the invariant characteristics of a movement pattern, which suggests that more than one observation is essential. If this is the case, then we would expect that the more frequently a beginner observes a skilled demonstration, the more opportunity the beginner will have to acquire the movement pattern. At least three research studies support this latter point. One, by Carroll and Bandura (1990), involves the learning of complex movement patterns of a computer joystick. Another, by Hand and Sidaway (1993), involves the learning of a golf skill. A third experiment by Hebert (2018) involves the learning of a cup stacking task. All three experiments provided evidence that more frequent observations of the model yielded better skill learning. The Hebert (2018) experiment revealed particularly interesting findings because learners practiced the task in groups of three, such that the first learner received no demonstration, the second learner observed the first learner complete all practice trials, and the third learner observed the first and second learners complete all practice trials. The second learner performed the task significantly faster than the first learner and the third learner performed significantly faster than the first and second learners during the acquisition phase of the experiment.
前面，我们指出，熟练执行者的示范向观察者传递了运动模式的不变特征，这表明多次观察示范是必不可少的。如果确实如此，那么我们可以预期，初学者观察熟练示范越频繁，他们掌握这个动作模式的可能性就越大。至少有三项研究支持这一观点：一项是 Carroll 和 Bandura （1990）和摇杆有关的复杂运动模式的学习的研究，另一项是 Hand 和 Sidaway （1993）关于学习高尔夫技能的研究，第三项是 Hebert（2018）关于杯子堆叠任务学习的研究。这三项实验都显示频繁地观察示范有助于技能学习。Hebert （2018）的研究有一个特别的发现：在他的实验中，学习者三人一组进行练习，这样组内第一位学习者没有观察到示范，第二位学习者观察到了第一位学习者的示范，第三位学习者观察到了第一位和第二位学习者的示范。结果，在实验的习得阶段，第二位学习者比第一位学习者执行任务的速度快得多，而第三位学习者又比前两位执行任务的速度快得多。

An experiment by Weeks and Anderson (2000), which investigated the issue of the timing of demonstrations, provides some additional insight into both the timing and frequency questions. The demonstrated skill involved a skilled volleyball player hitting an overhand serve. Participants, who had no previous experience hitting this serve, observed a video of ten demonstrations and performed thirty serves. The all-prepractice group watched all ten before performing the thirty serves; the interspersed group observed one demonstration and then performed three serves, in series throughout the practice period, and the combination group viewed five demonstrations before performing fifteen serves, then viewed five demonstrations before performing the final fifteen serves. All participants performed in two retention tests, which were 5 min and 48 hr, respectively, after the practice session. The results (figure 14.4) showed the benefit of the combination and all-prepractice conditions, as both led to better form and accuracy scores than the interspersed condition. In terms of the timing and frequency of demonstrations, these results indicate that several demonstrations should precede practice. Although it would be interesting to see how these demonstration schedules would have influenced learning had they been implemented in several days of practice, the results for one practice session reveal the importance of prepractice demonstrations. 
Weeks 和 Anderson （2000）的一项探讨示范的时机问题到研究，为示范的时间和频率问题提供了更深入的见解。示范动作是一名技术娴熟的排球运动员发飘球。之前没有发飘球经验的参与者要观看10次示范录像并进行30次发球。全预练习组在进行三十次发球前观看了全部的十次示范；穿插练习组先观看一次示范，然后在进行三次发球，依序完成全部练习；联合练习组则先观看5次示范，然后进行15次发球，之后再观看5次示范，完成剩余的15次发球。所有的受试者都参加了两次分别在练习课结束后的5分钟和48小时进行的保留测试。结果（见图14.4）显示，联合练习组和全预练习组相较于穿插练习组表现出更好的动作形态，动作准确性的得分也较高。这些结果表明，就示范的时间和频率而言，在练习之前应该进行示范。尽管这些研究探讨的是练习中的示范策略对技能学习的影响，但是这些结果还是揭示了在练习前进行示范的重要性。

A twist on the way in which demonstrations are scheduled has been to allow learners to self-select when they receive demonstrations. We will see in chapter 15 that this technique originated in the context of providing augmented feedback. Interestingly, when learners are given this opportunity they tend to request demonstrations very infrequently, often preceding less than 10 percent of the trials on which they could potentially request them. Ong and Hodges (2012) provided a summary of this research and highlighted some of the important gaps in our understanding of how to schedule observational practice.
这类研究还有一个变体，就是让学习者自己决定观察示范的时机。我们将在第15章看到，这种技术起源于提供增强反馈。有趣的是，当学习者有权决定示范的时机和频率时，他们倾向于安排很少的示范，通常不到他们实际上可以安排的10%。Ong 和 Hodges （2012）发表了关于这项研究的一份总结，表示我们在如何安排观察练习上存在许多重大的理解落差。

**Auditory Modeling**
**听觉示范**

Our discussion so far has focused on visual demonstration. However, there are skills for which visual demonstration is less effective for learning than other forms of demonstration. An example is a skill for which the *goal is to move in a certain criterion movement time or rhythm*. For these types of skill, an auditory form of demonstration seems to work best.
到目前为止，我们的讨论都聚焦在视觉示范上。然而，对于有些技能来说，视觉之外的其他形式的示范可能更有利于学习。例如，对于某些任务目标是*依照一定的标准动作时间或节奏*的技能，听觉形式的示范可能会更有效。

A good research example of the effectiveness of auditory modeling when the goal is a specific movement time is an experiment by Doody, Bird, and Ross (1985). The task required people to perform a complex sequential movement with one hand in a criterion movement time of 2.1 sec. Visual and auditory demonstration groups observed a videotape of a skilled model before each practice trial. The visual demonstration group saw only the video portion of the tape and heard no sound. The auditory demonstration group heard only the audio portion of the modeled performance but did not see the model perform the task. Results indicated that the group that heard the audio portion of the performance did better than the visual demonstration–only group.
Doody、Bird 和 Ross （1985）的研究就是探究按标准运动时间进行运动时，听觉示范有效性的一个典例。在这项研究中，受试者要在2.1秒的标准时机内完成一个单手复杂序列运动。视觉和听觉示范组在每次练习前都观看一个熟练示范者的示范录像带，但视觉示范组每次练习前只能看到录像带的画面，听不到声音；听觉示范组在每次练习前仅能听到录像带的声音，却看不到画面。结果表明，听觉示范组的执行表现比视觉示范组更好。

Three research examples showing the benefit of auditory modeling for learning a rhythmic sequence involve a sequence of dance steps, a golf putting task, and a laboratory task. In an experiment by Wuyts and Buekers (1995), people who had no prior dance or music experience learned a sequence of thirty-two choreographed steps. For acquiring the rhythmic timing of this sequence, participants who heard only the timing structure learned it as well as those who both saw and heard the model perform the sequence. The second experiment by Bieńkiewicz et al. (2019) focused on learning the rhythm of the golf putting stroke. Participants practiced with either an auditory template of the motion of the putter head, a visual template that used sequentially illuminated LEDs on a trackway positioned adjacent to the ball and aligned with the direction of the putter head, or with no template. The participants in the auditory and visual template groups showed larger improvements in putting performance than participants in the control group that received no template, though the differences were subtle. In addition, participants who practiced with the auditory template tended to retain their improvements better than those who practiced with the visual template. The third example is an experiment by Lai, Shea, Bruechert, and Little (2002) in which they found that auditory modeling enhanced the learning of a sequence of five time intervals when two keyboard keys were alternately depressed. Before each practice trial, participants heard a sequence of tones that represented the timing sequence they were to learn.
下面介绍三个关于听觉示范有利于学习节奏序列任务的研究实例，分别涉及舞步、高尔夫推杆和一项实验室任务。在 Wuyts 和 Buekers （1995）的实验中，先前没有舞蹈和音乐经验的受试者要学习一个包含 32 步舞蹈的动作序列。结果表明，与同时介绍视觉和听觉示范的受试者相比，仅通过听觉来了解动作时机的受试者在动作序列的时机节奏掌握方面毫不逊色。在 Bieńkiewicz 等人（2019）进行的学习高尔夫推杆节奏的实验中，受试者分为三组：一组使用推杆杆头（putter head）运动的听觉模板练习；一组使用视觉模板练习（该模板是由一串 LED 灯拼成的轨道，轨道的起始端在球附近，并与推杆杆头的方向对齐）；还一组不使用模板。结果显示，尽管差异不大，听觉模板组和视觉模板组在推杆表现上的提升还是比没有使用模板的控制组来的大。此外，用听觉模板练习的受试者与用视觉模板练习的参与者相比，往往能更好地保持他们的进步。最后一个例子是 Lai、Shea、Bruechert 和 Little （2002）的研究。他们的研究发现，听觉示范能促进一个依序敲键任务的表现，该任务包含五段，每段时间内受试者都要交替敲击两个按键。每次练习之前，受试者都会听到一系列音调，该音调代表了他们将要学习的按键时机。


**How the Observing of Demonstrations Influences Learning**
**观察示范如何影响学习**

In terms of learning theory, an important question is this: Why does observing demonstrations benefit motor skill learning? Two different views propose answers to this question.
从学习理论的角度，自然会提出一个重要的问题：为什么观察示范有利于运动技能的学习？对这一问题，有两种不同的解释。

**Cognitive mediation theory.** The predominant view is based on the work of Bandura (1986) concerning modeling and social learning. This view, called the **cognitive mediation theory,** proposes that when a person observes a model, he or she translates the observed movement information into a symbolic memory code that forms the basis of a stored representation in memory. The reason the person transforms movement information into a cognitive memory representation is so that the brain can then rehearse and organize the information. The memory representation then serves as a guide for performing the skill and as a standard for error detection and correction. To perform the skill, the person first must access the memory representation and then must translate it back into the appropriate motor control code to produce the body and limb movements. Thus, cognitive processing serves as a mediator between the perception of the movement information and the performance of the skill by establishing a cognitive memory representation between the perception and the action.
**认知调解理论**（Cognitive mediation theory） 这一理论最主要的观点来源于 Bandura （1986）关于示范和社会学习的研究。**认知调解理论**认为，当个体观察示范时，他们会将观察到的运动信息转化为符号进行记忆编码，这是记忆系统存储表征的基础。个体之所以要将运动信息转化为认知记忆表征，是为了使大脑能够复述和组织信息。之后，记忆表征将为技能的执行提供指导，为错误的觉察和校准提供标准。执行技能时，个体必须首先提取记忆表征，然后将其转化为恰当的运动控制变吗以产生身体和四肢的运动。这样，认知过程通过建立感知觉
与动作之间的认知记忆表征，起到调解感知运动信息和执行技能的作用。

According to Bandura, four subprocesses govern observational learning. The first is the *attention process,* which involves what the person observes and the information he or she extracts from the model’s actions. Because of the importance of the attention process for learning, directing full attention to the demonstration rather than the mere observation of it is important for optimal learning. The second is the *retention process,* in which the person transforms and restructures what he or she observes into symbolic codes that the person stores in memory. Certain cognitive activities, such as rehearsal, labeling, and organization, are involved in the retention process and benefit the development of this representation. The *behavior reproduction process* is the third subprocess; during it, the person translates the memory representation of the modeled action and turns it into physical action. Successful accomplishment of this process requires that the individual possess the physical capability to perform the modeled action. Finally, the *motivation process* involves the incentive or motivation to perform the modeled action. This process, then, focuses on all those factors that influence a person’s motivation to perform. Unless this process is completed, the person will not perform the action.
根据 Bandura 的观点，有四个子过程支配着观察学习。第一个是*注意过程*（attention process），包括个体观察到内容以及他们从示范者的动作中抽取出的信息。由于注意力在学习中起着重要的作用，因此为了取得良好的学习效果，不应该只是单纯的观察，而是要将全部的注意力导向示范。第二个子过程是*保持过程*（retention process），在此过程中，个体将观察到的信息转化和重新构建为符号编码，一遍存储在记忆中。某些认知活动，如复述（rehearsal）、标记（labeling）和组织整理（organization），都将参与这一过程并促进记忆表征的形成。第三个子过程是*行为复制过程*（behavior reproduction process），在这一过程中，个体将示范技能的记忆表征转化为身体动作。这一过程的成功进行需要个体有支配身体完成示范动作的能力。最后一个子过程是*动机过程*（motivation process），包括了激励或促进个体执行示范动作。如果动机过程没有完成，个体将不会执行该动作。

Several research studies have provided support for the cognitive mediation theory by demonstrating evidence that is in line with predictions of the theory. For example, Ste-Marie (2000) provided support for the prediction that *attention* is an important process in observational learning. In a series of four experiments, participants who had to divide their attention between performing a cognitive secondary task (counting backward by threes) and observing a model did not learn the skill as well as those who did not perform a secondary task. In an experiment discussed in chapter 10, Smyth and Pendleton (1990) showed that the prevention of the *rehearsal* process hindered learning a skill. In their experiment, some participants engaged in movement activity during the interval of time between the demonstration of a sequence of movements and their attempts to reproduce those movements. These participants recalled fewer movements than those who did not engage in activity during this time interval. Finally, Blandin and Proteau (2000) provided evidence that observational learning involves the development of effective *error detection and correction,* which the cognitive mediation theory describes as an important function of the memory representation that develops during observational learning. In two experiments, prior observation of a model permitted learners to estimate their errors as effectively as learners who had physically practiced the tasks.
有实验研究证实了认知调解理论的预测，从而支持了该理论。例如，Ste-Marie（2000）证实*注意过程*对观察学习至关重要。在该研究的四项实验中，一组受试者在观察示范者的同时要分出一部分注意力完成认知次级任务（倒数三），另一组受试者则不用执行该认知次级任务。结果发现，前者的表现水平较差。而在第10章中讨论过的 Smyth 和 Pendleton 的研究显示，阻止*复述*过程不利于技能学习。在他们的实验中，一部分受试者在观看示范和自己执行动作之间进行了额外的动作，结果相比于不进行额外动作的受试者，他们只能回忆起更少的动作。Blandin 和 Proteau （2000）提供的证据表明，观察学习包括有效地*觉察和纠正错误*，而这正是认知调解理论所认为的在观察学习中建立起来的记忆表征的重要功能。在这两个实验中，预先观察过示范的学习者在有效估计错误方面表现得和预先实际练习该任务的学习者无异。

**Dynamic view of modeling.** The second view is based on the direct perception view of vision proposed many years ago by J. J. Gibson (1966, 1979). Scully and Newell (1985) adapted Gibson’s view to the visual observation of a skilled demonstration and proposed the **dynamic view of modeling** as an alternative to Bandura’s theory. The dynamic view questions the need for a symbolic coding step (the memory representation step) between the observation of the modeled action and the physical performance of that action. Instead, it maintains, the visual system is capable of automatically processing visual information in such a way that it constrains the motor control system to act according to what the visual system detects. The visual system “picks up” from the model salient information that effectively constrains the body and limbs to act in specific ways. The person does not need to transform the information received via the visual system into a cognitive code and store it in memory. This is the case because the visual information directly provides the basis for coordination and control of the various body parts required to produce the action. Thus, the critical need for the observer in the early stage of learning is to observe demonstrations that enable him or her to perceive the important invariant coordination relationships between body parts. Additional observations of the model will benefit the learner by helping the person learn to parameterize the action.
**示范的动力学观点**（Dynamic view of modeling） 第二种观点基于 J. J. Gibson（1966，1979）多年前提出的视觉的直接知觉（direct perception view of vision）观点。Scully 和 Newell （1985）将 Gibson 的观点应用到运动技能示范的视觉观察情境中，并提出了  Bandura 理论之外的另一种观点：**示范的动力学观点**。这一观点对示范观察与身体执行动作之间的符号编码步骤（记忆表针步骤）的必要性提出了质疑。该理论认为视觉系统可以自动地加工视觉信息，使运动控制系统按照视觉觉察到的信息运动。知觉系统从示范中抽取特定的信息，可以有效地控制身体和四肢按照特定的方式运动。个体不需要将视觉系统获得的信息转化为认知编码存储在记忆中。这是因为视觉信息直接为产生动作所需的各种身体部位的协调和控制提供了基础。因此，在学习的早期阶段，观察者最主要的需求是观察示范，使他们能够感知身体各部分之间重要的不变协调关系。对示范的额外观察将有助于学习者的动作参数化（parameterize the action）。

**Which view is correct?** Unfortunately, there is no conclusive evidence in the research literature that shows one of these two views of the modeling effect to be the more valid one. As you saw in the discussions of each view, both have research support for some specific assertions. As a result, until we have research evidence that one view cannot explain, we must consider which view is a possible explanation of why modeling benefits skill acquisition. The cognitive mediation theory has been the more prominent of the two, receiving more attention in motor skills research. However, the dynamic view has attracted a number of proponents.
**哪个观点是正确的？** 很遗憾，在研究文献中并没有决定性的证据证明这两个观点中的哪一个更可信。如前文所述，这两种理论的某些主张都有研究支持。因此，只有当其中的一种理论无法解释某些研究结果时，我们猜需要考虑哪一种观点更加正确。在这两种理论中，认知协调理论更加主流，受到了更多运动技能研究的关注。不过，动力学观点也逐渐地为更多人所接受。

**Final Caveats**
**最后的警告**

Though considerable evidence indicates that patterns of coordination can be acquired more quickly when learners are provided with demonstrations, we should keep in mind that there are potential downsides to providing demonstrations. 
尽管大量的证据表明，当向学习者提供示范时，他们可以更快地习得协调模式，但应该注意，提供示范也有潜在的不利方面。
For example, in discussing what they referred to as the “ideal form myth,” Spaeth (1972) and J. Higgins (1977) argued that so many factors influence how movements are organized, it is highly unlikely that a single, universal way of performing a skill is appropriate for every learner. 
例如，Spaeth （1972）和 J. Higgins （1977）在讨论他们所谓的“理想形式神话（ideal form myth）”时提出，影响动作组织方式的因素如此之多，不可能有一种单一的、通用的方法适用于每个学习者。
Consequently, what researchers consider a skilled demonstration does not necessarily represent the ideal form for every learner. In a related vein, S. Higgins (1991) has argued that providing learners with other people’s strategies for solving movement problems, via demonstrations, can actually subvert the problem solving that is so central to learning. 
因此，研究人员认为熟练个体的示范不一定代表每个学习者的理想形式。与此相关的是，S. Higgins （1991）认为，通过示范向学习者提供其他人解决运动问题的策略，实际上可能破坏学习者的问题解决过程，而这一过程在学习过程中占核心地位。
Finally, Kardas and O’Brien (2018) have shown in a series of experiments that watching skilled performers can foster a potentially dangerous illusion of skill acquisition. Importantly, the illusion does not coincide with the observer’s actual ability to perform the skill that was observed. The more observers watch the skilled performer, the stronger is the illusion of skill acquisition. 
最后，Kardas 和 O'Brien （2018）在一系列实验中表明，观察熟练的示范者可能会培养出一种危险的错觉，即错误判断自己的技能习得程度。重要的是，这种错觉与观察者执行所观察技能的实际能力并不一致。观察者观看熟练示范者的次数越多，技能习得的错觉就越强烈。
This illusion can be especially dangerous when observers attempt to perform skills that are clearly beyond their capabilities and that pose risks for injury. Such skills might include skateboard tricks, gymnastics stunts, or Parkour maneuvers–skills that can be readily viewed on platforms like YouTube.
当观察者试图执行明显超出他们能力的技能时，这种错觉尤其危险，会将他们暴露于受伤的风险中。这些技能可能包括滑板技巧、体操特技或跑酷动作——这些技能的视频在 YouTube 等平台上唾手可得。

**VERBAL INSTRUCTIONS AND CUES**
**口授与线索**

Verbal instructions rank with demonstration as a commonly used means of communicating to people how to perform motor skills. Research supports the value of verbal instructions for facilitating skill acquisition. However, it is important to note that several factors are important for developing effective verbal instruction. Some of these factors are discussed in the following sections.
口授和示范都是向个体传递运动技能执行方式的常用手段。研究证据肯定了口授在促进技能习得方面的价值。不过，有些因素对有效地进行口授起着尤为重要的作用，下面几节将来讨论这些因素。

**Verbal Instructions and Attention**
**口授与注意力**

An important performer characteristic we discussed in chapter 9 that relates to giving verbal instructions is that the person has a limited capacity to attend to information. Because of this limitation, practitioners must take into account several characteristics about the instructions they give. We will consider some of these in the following sections.
前面在第9章谈到，提供口授与个体有限的注意力容量相关。由于这种容量的有限性，指导者在进行指导时需要关注指导的某些特征。在下面几小节将探讨这些特征。

**The quantity of instructions.** It is easy to overwhelm the person with instructions about what to do to perform a skill. We can reasonably expect that a beginner will have difficulty paying attention to more than one or two instructions about what to do. Because the beginner will need to divide attention between remembering the instructions and actually performing the skill, a minimal amount of verbal information can exceed the person’s attention-capacity limits. In addition to concerns about attention capacity, the instructor should be aware of other important attention-related considerations when giving verbal instructions, some of which are discussed in the following sections.
**指令的数量** 向个体口授如何执行技能时，很容易超出个体能力范围。我们可以认为，在一定程度上，初学者很难同时注意一个或两个以上的指令。这是因为出现在需要将注意力分配到记忆指令和实际执行技能两个方面，所以即使很少的语言信息都可能超出个体的注意力容量上限【】。除此之外，指导者在提供指令时还应该考虑到其他与注意力相关的重要事项。

**Verbal instructions to focus attention on movement outcomes.** An important function of instructions is to direct learners’ attention to focus on the features of the skill or environmental context that will enhance their performance of the skill. 
**将注意力聚焦于运动结果的口授指令** 指令的一个重要功能是将学习者的注意力指向、集中于有利于执行技能的关键信息上。
A key point with regard to the content of these instructions relates to our discussion of attention and consciousness in chapter 9. Recall that attention can be either conscious or nonconscious, with the person either aware or not aware of what is being attended to. 
这与我们在第9章讨论的注意和意识有关。当时提到，注意可以被个体意识到，也可以不被个体意识到。
When we relate this point to attention focus during the performance of a motor skill, we need to review research we briefly discussed in chapter 9, which showed that a key part of skill learning is *where* a person directs his or her conscious attention when performing a skill. 
当谈到注意焦点时，我们需要简要回顾一下第9章讨论过的研究证据，该研究显示执行技能时的注意指向是技能学习的关键。
That research evidence was based on investigations of the *action effect hypothesis* (Prinz, 1997), which proposes that actions are best planned and controlled by their intended effects. 
这一研究证据来自于对*动作效果假说*（action effect hypothesis）的探讨（Prinz, 1997），该理论认为动作都由预定效果（intended effects）周详地计划和控制。
The hypothesis predicts that actions will be more effective when a person focuses his or her attention on the intended outcomes of an action, rather than on the movements required by the skill. 
根据这一假说，当个体把注意力集中在动作的预期结果上，而不是技能要求的动作上时，会取得更好的执行效果。
To test the action effect hypothesis in motor skill learning situations, researchers have designed experiments in which instructions that direct participants’ attention to their own movements (i.e., internal focus of attention) are compared to those that direct attention to the movement outcome (i.e., external focus of attention) (see Wulf, 2007, 2013, Wulf & Lewthwaite, 2016, and Wulf & Prinz, 2001, for reviews of this research).
为了测试运动技能学习情境中的动作效果假说，研究人员设计了一些实验，比较了引导受试者注意自身运动的指令（即内部注意焦点）与引导受试者注意运动结果的指令（即外部注意焦点）（该研究的综述可参见 Wulf, 2007, 2013, Wulf & Lewthwaite, 2016； Wulf & Prinz, 2001）。

The following research examples illustrate two types of experiments that have tested and supported the action effect hypothesis. And they demonstrate *two different ways to give verbal instructions to direct attention to movement outcomes.* The first involves instructions presented in a way that establishes a *discovery learning* situation. This means that the instructions focus the learner’s attention on the action goal of the skill. Then, as the learner practices the skill, he or she “discovers” how to move to achieve that goal. The second example involves the *use of metaphoric imagery* (sometimes called *verbal analogies*) in instructions, which directs the learner’s attention to move according to the image, which is the intended movement outcome of the skill. Recall that we discussed the use of metaphoric images in chapter 10 as a strategy for enhancing memory.
下面的研究实例展示了验证和支持动作效果假说的两类实验，而且示范了*两种指向运动结果的口授方式*。第一种是以建立*发现学习*（discovery learning）情境的方式来进行指导，就是将学习中的注意立导向技能的动作目标。然后，当学习者练习技能时，他们将“发现”应该如何运动才能达到动作目标。第二种是在指导中*使用运动技能预期结果的表象*（use of metaphoric imagery，有时也叫 verbal analogies），可以使学习者根据表象将注意力导向运动。在第10章中，我们已讨论过使用表象来增强记忆。

In a study reported by Wulf and Weigelt (1997) participants practiced the slalom ski simulator task (described earlier in this chapter and pictured in figure 14.2). Everyone was told that the goal of the task was to continuously move the platform for 90 sec as far as possible to the left and right at a rate of one complete cycle every 2 sec. Participants in one group were also told to try to exert force on the platform after it passed the center of the ski simulator, based on a movement characteristic of people who demonstrated high performance levels on the ski simulator. Another group was not given this additional instruction, which means the only instructions they received concerned the action goal (i.e., the desired effect of their movements). Because they were told only about the action goal, this group experienced a discovery learning situation.
Wulf 和 Weigelt （1997）报告的研究中，受试者练习障碍滑雪模拟器任务（本章前面介绍过，见图14.2）。所有受试者都被告知目标是尽可能远地向左右连续移动平台90秒，并且必须在2秒内完成一次左右移动。其中一组受试者被告知经过平台的中心后再发力（这是根据熟练示范个体的运动特征得到的），另一组受试者则没有接受这些额外指导，即这组受试者只获得关于动作目标的指导（也就是运动的预期目标）。也正因为这一组只被告知了运动目标，所以他们会经历发现学习情境。

As figure 14.5 shows, the additional movement attention-directing instructions led to poorer performance during practice trials and on a transfer test in which participants performed under stress (they were told they were being observed and evaluated by a skiing expert). Interestingly, in a follow-up experiment, which was based on the assumption that more experience with the task would allow participants to direct more attention to the specific information in the instructions, the attention-directing instructions were given after three days of practice. But, once again, rather than aid learning, the instructions had a negative effect.
如图 14.5 所示，额外的运动注意力引导指令导致受试者在练习测试和压力情境下的迁移测试中表现较差（他们被告知有滑雪专家观看和评价他们的表现）。有趣的是，在一项后续实验中，注意力引导指令在三天的练习后才给出，这一实验的基本假设是，丰富的运动经验会让受试者更多地关注指令中的特定信息。但是，注意力引导指令再一次起到了负面效应，而不是有利于学习。

Numerous other research investigations have found that instructions that promote an external focus of attention lead to better learning than an internal focus. These studies are especially noteworthy because they have found this benefit for a variety of motor skills, such as swinging a golf club, shooting a basketball, serving a volleyball, passing in soccer, and throwing a dart. In addition, instructions to focus attention externally have been shown to benefit the learning of balance skills by healthy adults as well as those who have Parkinson’s disease or who have had a stroke. (For brief reviews of the research showing these results, see Emanuel, Jarus, & Bart, 2008; Wulf, 2013; Wulf & Su, 2007; Wulf, Landers, Lewthwaite, & Tšllner, 2009; and Wulf & Lewthwaite, 2016.) 
许多其他研究调查发现，促进外部注意力集中的指令比促进内部注意力集中的指令能带来更好的学习效果。这些研究尤其值得注意，因为研究发现这种益处对各种运动技能都成立，如挥动高尔夫球杆、投篮、打排球、传球和投掷飞镖。此外，将注意力集中在外部的指令已被证明有利于健康成年人以及帕金森病患者或中风患者学习平衡技能。(关于这些研究的简要综述，见 Emanuel, Jarus, & Bart, 2008; Wulf, 2013; Wulf & Su, 2007; Wulf, Landers, Lewthwaite, & Tšllner, 2009; and Wulf & Lewthwaite, 2016。)

An experiment in which instructions used *metaphoric imagery* to direct attention to the movement outcome was reported by Wulf, Lauterbach, and Toole (1999). Participants, who were university students with no previous experience playing golf, practiced hitting golf pitch shots into a circular target from a distance of 15 m. Everyone was given the same demonstration and instructions about the stance and how to grip the club. But one group was told to focus their attention on the swinging motion of the arms during each swing. These participants also received specific instructions about the various movements involved in the swing and practiced several swings without holding a club before they practiced hitting a ball. A second group was told to focus their attention on the club head’s pathway during the back- and downswing (i.e., the “action effect”). They received specific instructions that emphasized the metaphor of the pendulum-like motion of the club. The results showed that the participants who directed their attention to the club movement consistently produced higher target accuracy scores during practice trials and on a 24-hr retention test.
Wulf、Lauterbach 和 Toole （1999）报告了在指导中使用*表象*将注意力导向运动结果的实验研究。实验中的受试者为先前没有高尔夫运动经验的大学生，他们要学习斜击高尔夫球进入15米元的环形目标。所有受试者都接受了同样的关于站立姿势和抓球棒方式的示范与指导。但是，其中一组受试者额外被告知在每次摆动时将注意力集中在手臂的摆动动作，而且还额外接受了关于不同摆动动作的特别指导，还在练习击球之前，空手练习了几次摆臂动作。另外一组受试者则是被告知在向后摆臂和回摆的时将注意力集中于球棒头部的运动路径（即“运动效果”）。他们获得的特别指导则强调了球棒的钟摆式运动。结果显示，将注意力集中与球棒运动的受试者在练习和24小时保留测试中都表现出较高的目标准确得分。

Verbal analogies. Like metaphors, analogies are verbal descriptions designed to highlight the similarities between two things. By highlighting the similarities to something we already know and understand, analogies help us to comprehend something we have not encountered before. For example, we often compare the human brain to a computer to facilitate understanding of how the brain works. Similarly, in the movement domain, we might compare skipping to a “bouncy walk” to give learners an idea of how to perform the movement without overburdening them with excessive verbal descriptions of how the body parts should move.
口头类比（Verbal analogies）。和隐喻（metaphors）一样，类比也是一种旨在突出两个事物之间的相似性的口头描述。类比通过强调新事物和我们已经知道和理解的东西的相似性，帮助我们理解以前没有遇到过的东西。例如，在理解大脑是如何工作时，我们经常将人脑比作计算机。类似地，在运动领域，我们可以将跳绳比作“蹦蹦跳跳的走路”，以便让学习者知道如何进行运动，而不要用过多的语言描述身体各部位应该如何运动，让他们负担过重。

Richard Masters and his colleagues have argued that movement analogies are effective instructional strategies because they encourage *implicit learning*—a form of learning that occurs without conscious awareness of what is being learned (see the next section for examples). For example, Masters and Poolton (2012) reviewed a body of research showing that implicitly learned tasks tend to be less susceptible to stress or pressure than explicitly learned tasks. 
Richard Masters 和 他的同事认为，动作类比之所以是有效的教学策略，因为这种方式促进了“隐式学习”（implicit learning） —— 一种在没有意识到正在学习什么的情况下发生的学习形式(见下一节的例子)。例如，Masters 和 Poolton （2012）回顾了一系列研究，表明隐式学习任务比显式学习任务更不容易受到压力的影响。
The explanation for this finding is similar to the explanation that has been proposed to account for the benefits of an external focus of attention. Masters hypothesizes that when explicitly taught learners are put under pressure, they revert back to a movement-control strategy that is based on explicit, verbalizable rules. This reversion to a highly conscious form of processing, referred to as *reinvestment* (Masters & Maxwell, 2008), interferes with more automatic control processes and destabilizes performance. According to Masters, instructional strategies that minimize the accrual of explicit knowledge about how to move can help learners to bypass Fitts and Posner’s (1967) *cognitive stage* of learning (introduced in chapter 12) and avoid reverting to that stage when stressful situations are encountered. Several studies support this assertion (e.g., Lee, Acu–a, Kording, & Grafton, 018).
对这一发现的解释类似于对外部注意力集中的好处的解释。Masters  假设，当显式学习的学习者受到压力时，他们会回到基于明确的、可描述的规则的运动控制策略。这种向高度自觉的处理形式的回归，被称为*重利用*（reinvestment） (Masters & Maxwell，2008)，会干扰更自动化的控制过程，并使表现水平不稳定。根据 Masters 的说法，最大限度地减少教授身体移动的显性知识的策略可以帮助学习者避开 Fitts 和Posner（1967）的*学习认知阶段*（*cognitive stage* of learning，将在第12章中介绍），并且避免在遇到压力时重新回到那个阶段。有几项研究支持这一论断(例如，Lee, Acu–a, Kording, & Grafton, 018)。

Liao and Masters (2001) provided an example of how analogies could be used to minimize the accrual of explicit knowledge as beginners learned to impart overspin to a ball during a table tennis forehand shot. Rather than provide instructions about how to move the arm and paddle to accomplish the task, learners were simply told to swing the bat up the hypotenuse of an imagined right-angled triangle each time they hit the ball. The learners who were given this instruction were able to perform the shot more effectively than learners who were given explicit instructions about how to move the arm and paddle, when the groups were put under pressure or asked to concurrently perform a secondary task while making the shot.
Liao 和 Masters（2001）提供了一个例子，说明在初学者学习乒乓球正手击球时如何使用类比来最小化显式知识的积累。这个例子中的策略是：不提供如何移动手臂和球拍来完成任务的指导，而是简单地告诉学习者每次击球时将球拍挥向想象中的直角三角形的斜边。在压力情境下或被要求在击球时同时执行一项次要任务的情境下，与接受显式指导手臂和球拍如何运动的受试者相比，这组受试者能够更有效地完成击球。

**Verbal instructions to focus attention on invariant environmental context regulatory conditions.**
**在口授中将注意力聚焦于不变的环境条件**
Another issue associated with attention and the content of instructions relates to the selective attention problem of what in the environment to look for that will help perform a skill. The importance of this issue relates to a critical goal of the initial stage of learning, accordingly to Gentile’s learning stages model. As we discussed in chapter 12, this goal is to learn the regulatory conditions that direct the movements required to achieve the action goal of the skill.
另一个与注意力指向和口授内容相关的议题是告知个体在环境中寻找什么信息，以帮助他们学习执行技能。根据 Gentile 的学习阶段模型，这一议题的重要性与学习最初阶段的重要目标相关。正如第12章中所探讨的，这一目标是学习哪些对达到动作目标有影响的调控条件。

Sometimes we ask people to tell us what they were looking for or looking at when they performed a skill, so that we can help them correct their visual attention focus. However, research investigating the need for conscious awareness of environmental cues when learning skills reveals that people can learn to select relevant cues from the environment without being consciously aware of what those cues are.
有时我们会询问个体在执行技能时在寻找什么或在看什么，这样可以帮助他们校准视觉注意到焦点。然而，探讨环境线索意识知觉必要性的实验研究揭示，人们可以在意识上不知道这些信息是什么的情况下从环境中获得相关信息。

A good example of research demonstrating this result is an experiment reported by Magill (1998). 
Magill （1998）的研究是一个很好的实例。
Participants watched a target cursor move in a complex waveform pattern across a computer screen for 60 sec. The participants’ task involved pursuit tracking of the target cursor by moving a lever on a tabletop to make their own cursor stay as close as possible to the target cursor. 
受试者的任务是通过操作桌面上的摇杆，以追踪电脑屏幕上以复杂波状轨迹移动的目标光标，目标是使得自己的光标尽可能地靠近目标光标。
The unique feature was that the target cursor moved randomly for the second and third 20 sec segments on every trial, but it made the same movements on every trial during the first 20 sec segment. 
目标光标的独特之处是，在每次练习的第2个和第3个20秒到部分，目标光标的移动是随机的，但是在每次练习的前29秒内目标光标的移动模式却是一致的。

The participants practiced this pursuit tracking task for approximately twenty-four trials on each of fifteen days. The results, shown in figure 14.6, indicated that as they practiced, they performed better on the first segment than on the other two segments. But what is more important is that when interviewed, none of the participants indicated that they knew that the target cursor made the same pattern during the first segment on every trial. Thus the participants attended to and used the regularity of the cursor movement during the first segment, even though they were not consciously aware of that characteristic. This lack of conscious awareness of the invariant movement pattern of the target cursor indicates that the participants *implicitly* learned the regulatory environmental context features that directed their movements as they tracked the target cursor.
受试者练习该任务15天，每天练习24次。如图14.6，结果显示随着练习的进行，受试者在第一部分的操作好于其他两个部分。但更为重要的是，当受试者在接受访谈时，没有人报告说他们知道每次练习中的目标光标在第一部分的运动模式时完全相同的。因此，受试者关注并使用光标在第一部分中的规律性移动，尽管他们在意识上并没有觉察到这些特征。个体在意识中并没有感知目标光标固定不变的运动形式，这一事实表明受试者*隐式*地学习到了环境的规律性特征，这些特征在他们追踪目标光标时引导了他们的注意力。

Although the research just described indicates that people can learn to use relevant environmental context features without being instructed to look for them, there is a common assumption that we can facilitate skill learning by giving instructions that would make people aware of these features. For example, a tennis teacher may tell a student that a certain racquet-head angle at ball contact during a serve indicates a specific type of serve, which the student should try to look for to predict that type of serve. However, what is not so commonly known is that this type of instruction could actually hinder rather than facilitate learning, especially when the specific features looked for occur infrequently in a series of trials.
尽管刚才描述的这一研究显示，个体不需要指令指导，就可以学会使用相关的环境特征，但普遍存在的一种认识是我们可以通过口授使个体感知到这些特征，从而促进学习。例如，网球教练可以告诉学生发球时拍头击球到角度不同可以带来发球类型的变化，这些本是学生预测发球类型时应该寻找的信息。然而，鲜为人知的是，这类口授阻碍而非促进了技能的学习，尤其是当所要寻找的特征在一系列练习中较少出现时。

Green and Flowers (1991) reported an experiment that serves as a good example of the research evidence demonstrating this negative effect. Participants played a computer game in which they manipulated a joystick to move a paddle horizontally across the bottom of the monitor to try to catch a “ball,” which was a dot of light, that moved for 
2.5 sec from the top to the bottom of the screen. The ball moved according to one of eight pathways. 
Green 和 Flowers （1991）的研究很好地这种负面效应。受试者玩一个电脑游戏，目标是操纵摇杆水平移动球拍越过显示器的底部，并捕捉一个“小球“，该球是一个光点，从屏幕底部移动到顶部需要2.5秒。小球每次按照8种可能路径中的一种进行移动。
On 75 percent of the trials, the ball made deviations from the normal pathway that predicted the specific final position of the ball. Thus, participants’ detection of these pathway-deviations characteristics could help them increase their catching accuracy. One group of participants received explicit instructions about these characteristics and their probability of occurring; the other group did not. Participants practiced for five days for a total of 800 trials. The results showed that both groups improved. However, the explicit-instruction group made more errors than the group that had had no instruction. The authors concluded that the instructed participants directed so much of their attentional resources to trying to remember the rule and looking for its occurrence that their performance was disrupted, because they did not have sufficient attention to devote to the catching task itself.
在75%的练习中，小球都会偏离正常的移动路径。因此，如果受试者能觉察出路径偏移的特征，将有助于提高捕捉准确性。一组受试者接受了显式指导，包括这些特征以及出现概率；另外一组受试者则没有接受类似指导。所有受试者在5天内总共进行了800次尝试。结果显示两个组的表现都有提高。然而，显式指导组比无指导组犯的错误更多。作者归结为获得指导的受试者将更多的注意资源指向记忆这些规则，并寻找这些规则的出现，这反而干扰了他们的表现，因为这样一来他们就没有足够的注意力资源分配给捕捉任务本身。

Research has also shown the negative influence of explicit information on the implicit learning of an open motor skill by stroke patients. In an experiment by Boyd and Winstein (2004), patients who had experienced a basal ganglia stroke practiced a pursuit tracking task similar to the one described earlier in the Magill (1998) study, except that a trial was only 30 sec. One group of patients was told about the repeating portion of the pathway. Rather than helping the patients to perform the task better than those who were not given this information, the awareness of this task characteristic led to poorer learning.
研究还表明，显式信息对中风患者开放式运动技能的隐式学习有负面影响。在 Boyd 和Winstein （2004）的一项实验中，经历过基底神经节中风的患者进行了一项类似于先前在 Magill （1998）研究中描述的追踪任务，唯一的变化是每次试验只有30秒。一组病人被告知该路径的重复部分。结果表明，接受了额外指导的病人并没有比那些没有得到这些信息的病人更好地完成任务，这种对任务特征的了解反而造成了较差的学习效果。

**Verbal Instructions Influence Goal Achievement Strategies: Speed-Accuracy Skill Instructions**
**口授影响目标成就策略：以快而准确技能的指令为例**

Another factor that we need to consider is that verbal instructions direct the person’s attention to certain performance goals of the skill. A good example of this is the way verbal instructions can bias the strategy a person uses to learn speed-accuracy skills which we discussed in chapter 7. 
另一个需要探讨的是口授将个体的注意力导向技能的表现不表。一个很好的例子就是在学习快而准确的技能（见第7章）时，口授可以使个体使用的策略发生偏移。
An experiment by Blais (1991) illustrates this type of strategy bias. The task was a serial pursuit tracking task in which participants controlled a steering wheel to align a pointer as quickly and accurately as possible to target positions on a screen. Three groups of participants received verbal instructions that emphasized being accurate, being fast, or being both accurate and fast. On this day, the “speed instruction” group recorded the fastest movement times, whereas the “accuracy group” produced the most accurate performance. 
Blais （1991）的实验显示了这种策略偏移。实验包括一系列追踪任务，受试者要控制方向盘，将面前显示器上的指针尽可能快而准地排列到指定位置。三组受试者接受到的口授分别强调准确性、强调快速和强调快速而准确。在这天，“快速指令”组的动作时间最段，而“准确指令”组表现得则最准。
The group told to emphasize both speed and accuracy adopted a strategy that led to fast movement times—but at the expense of performance accuracy. And although the “accuracy instruction” group performed the most accurately, its participants did so in a manner that eventually gave them the fastest average overall response time, which included reaction time, movement time, and movement-correction time for errors. Thus, for this task, where both speed and accuracy were equally important for overall performance, instructions that initially emphasized accuracy led to the best achievement of the two-component goal.
而速度和准确性都强调的组采用的策略最终产生了较短的动作时间，但却是以牺牲准确性为代价的。而且，尽管“准确指令”组执行动作的准确度最高，但这些受试者最终表现出最短的平均总反应时，包括反应时、运动时以及运动校准的时间。因此，对于既要求速度也要去准确性的任务，指导时强调准确性可以较好地兼顾这两方面的目标。

The results of the Blais (1991) experiment are consistent with predictions of both the motor program and dynamical systems theories we discussed in chapter 5. To apply the speed-accuracy skill to those theories, the movement accuracy component refers to the movement pattern used to perform the skill. In both theories the movement pattern consists of invariant characteristics that remain the same when the skill is performed at different speeds. For these motor control theories, movement speed can be readily changed according to the demands of the performance situation or intention of the performer. As a result, these theories predict that initial practice for a speed-accuracy skill should emphasize movement accuracy and a later emphasis on the speed component.
Blais （1991）的实验结果与在第五章讨论的运动程序和动力系统理论的预测是一致的。从这些理论的角度看快而准确技能，运动准确性部分指的是用于执行该技能的运动模式。在这两种理论中，运动模式由相对不变的特征组成，即当技能以不同的速度进行时，这些特征保持不变。根据这些运动控制理论，运动速度可以根据执行情境的要求或执行者的意图而轻易地改变。因此，这些理论预测，快而准确技能在练习的初始阶段应该强调动作的准确性，随后强调速度部分。

**Verbal Cues**
**口头提示**

One of the potential problems associated with verbal instructions is that they can contain too little or too much information and not provide the learner with what he or she needs to know to achieve the goal of the skill. To overcome this problem, instructors can use verbal cues (Landin, 1994). **Verbal cues** are short, concise phrases that serve to (1) direct the performer’s attention to regulatory conditions in the environmental context or (2) prompt key movement components of skills. For example, the cue “Look at the ball” directs visual attention, whereas the cue “Bend your knee” prompts an essential movement component. Research has shown these short, simple statements to be very effective as verbal instructions to facilitate learning new skills, as well as performing well-learned skills. Teachers, coaches, or therapists can implement verbal cues in several different ways in skill learning settings.
与口授相关的一个潜在问题是指令承载的信息可能过多也可能过少，而且还有可能没有提供学习者为达到技能目标所必须的指导信息。为了克服这一问题，指导者可以使用口头提示（Landin, 1994）。**口头提示**（Verbal cues）是简短而精炼的短语，用于：（1）将个体的注意力导向环境情境中的规律性提示；（2）促进技能关键动作部分的掌握，例如，“看球”这一提示指引视觉注意，而“曲膝”提示则促进关键动作部分的掌握。研究已经表明，这些简单的话语作为指令是非常有效的，既可以促进新技能的学习，又可以帮助已习得技能的执行。

**Verbal cues and demonstrations.** One way is to *give verbal cues along with a demonstration* to supplement the visual information (e.g., McCullagh, Stiehl, & Weiss, 1990; Zetou, Tzetzis, Vernadakis, & Kioumourtzoglou, 2002). When used this way, verbal cues aid in directing attention, and can guide rehearsal of the skill a person is learning. An example of a study showing the benefit of this use of verbal cues was reported by Janelle, Champenoy, Coombes, and Mousseau (2003) for learning a soccer accuracy pass. 
**口头提示与示范** 给出口头提示的一种方式是*随示范一起给出口头提示*，以补充视觉信息（例如，McCullagh, Stiehl, & Weiss, 1990; Zetou, Tzetzis, Vernadakis, & Kioumourtzoglou, 2002）。按照这种方式进行指导时，口头提示有助于引导注意力，并能引导个体对技能的回忆。Janelle、Champenoy、Coombes和 Mousseau （2003）的一项学习足球准确传球的实验展示了这种方式的对学习的益处。
Non-soccer players who observed a skilled model video demonstration with accompanying verbal and visual cues learned the pass with more appropriate form and outcome accuracy than in five other practice conditions. The verbal cues, which were presented by audiotape along with the video, were short descriptions of the specific movement characteristics of the critical areas of the kick. 
在实验中，一组非足球运动员观看了一个带有口头和视觉提示的熟练示范者的视频示范。与其他五种练习条件相比，通过这种方式，他们学会了更恰当的传球形式，结果也更准确。这些口头提示是用录音和视频画面一起呈现的，包含对踢球关键部位的特定运动特征的简短描述。
The visual cues were arrows on the video that pointed to the critical areas of the kick. The comparison practice conditions involved discovery learning (i.e., they were told the accuracy goal of the skill but had to “discover” the best way to pass the ball to achieve the goal), verbal instructions only, a skilled model video demonstration with the visual cues, a skilled model video demonstration with the verbal cues, and a skilled model video demonstration only. 
视频中的视觉提示是指向踢腿关键区域的箭头。用于比较的其余几种练习条件包括：发现学习(即受试者只被告知技能的准确性目标，必须自己“发现”实现目标的最佳传球方式)、仅口头指导、带有视觉提示的熟练示范者的视频示范、带有口头提示的熟练示范者的视频示范以及仅熟练示范者的视频示范。
Note that in this study the addition of visual cues enhanced the benefit of the verbal cues. Together, the visual arrows and the verbal cues focused the participants’ attention to the parts of the skill that were critical to successful performance. Although we are focused on verbal cues here, it is relevant to note that a study by D’Innocenzo, Gonzalez, Williams, and Bishop (2016) showed that the learning of golf swing was accelerated by the use of color patches on a video demonstration that visually guided participants to look at key features of the setup.
值得注意的是，在这项研究中，视觉提示的加入增强了口头提示的益处。箭头指引和口头提示一起将参与者的注意力集中到对成功表现至关重要的那些技能部分。虽然在这里我们关注的是口头提示，但值得一提的是，D'Innocenzo、Gonzalez、Williams 和 Bishop （2016）的研究表明，在视频示范中使用彩色斑点可以直观地引导受试者查看任务的关键特征，进而加速高尔夫挥杆的学习。

**Verbal cues that focus attention while performing.**
**用于集中注意力的口头提示**
Another way to use verbal cues is to *give cues to help learners focus on critical parts of skills.* For example, in an experiment by Masser (1993), first-grade classes were taught to do headstands. In one class, before students made each attempt to swing their legs up into the headstands, the instructor said, “Shoulders over your knuckles,” to emphasize the body position critical to performing this skill. The cued students maintained their acquired skill three months after practice, whereas the students who had not received this verbal cue performed the headstand poorly three months later. A similar result occurred in an experiment using verbal cues to emphasize critical parts of the forward roll.
另一种使用口头提示的方法是*提供帮助学习者聚焦于技能关键部分的提示*。例如，在 Masser （1993）的实验中，实验人员指导一年级学生学习头手倒立。有一个班的学生每次在后摆腿做头手倒立之前，指导者都会说“让肩膀越过你的指关节（Shoulders over your knuckles）”，以强调这一重要的身体姿势。获得这种提示道学生即使在练习后的三个月仍留存着该技能，而没有获得口头提示的学生在练习后三个月执行头手倒立的表现则较差。在使用口头提示强调前滚翻技能关键部分的实验中也得到了类似的结果。

**Verbal cues as prompts.** Performers also can *use verbal cues while performing* to prompt themselves to attend to or perform key aspects of skills. Cutton and Landin (1994) provided a research example demonstrating the effectiveness of this technique for nonskilled individuals. Instructors taught university students in a beginning tennis class five verbal cues to say out loud each time they were required to hit a ball. These were as follows: “ready,” to prompt preparation for the oncoming ball; “ball,” to focus attention on the ball itself; “turn,” to prompt proper body position to hit the ball, which included turning the hips and shoulders to be perpendicular with the net and pointing the racquet toward the back fence; “hit,” to focus attention on contacting the ball; and “head down,” to prompt the stationary position of the head after ball contact. The students who used verbal cues learned tennis groundstrokes better than those who did not, including a group that received verbal feedback during practice.
**作为提醒的口头提示** 执行者*在执行技能时可以使用口头提示*来提醒自己执行这些技能的关键部分。Cutton 和 Landin （1994）的研究显示了这一技术对非熟练个体的效用。指导者在指导大学网球初级班的学生时，要求他们每次击球时大声说出 5 个口头提示。这些提示是：“准备”（ready）以提示对即将到来的球的准备；“球”（ball）将注意力集中到球本身；“转身”（turn）以提示击球的恰当身体位置，包括转动臀与肩与球网垂直，并向后引拍；“击球”（hit）将注意力集中于击球；“头向下”（head down）以提示击球后头的固定位置。与没有使用提示的组（包括在练习中获得了语言反馈的组）相比，使用提示的组更好地学习了网球的基本击打动作。

**Verbal cues aid skilled performance.** Verbal cues have also been used to *improve the performance of skilled athletes*. For example, Landin and Hebert (1999) had university female varsity tennis players use self-cueing to help them improve their volleying skills.  Players learned to say the word “split,” to cue them to hop to a balanced two-foot stop that would allow them to move in any direction. Then, they said, “turn,” to cue them to turn their shoulders and hips to the ball. Finally, they said, “hit,” to direct their attention to tracking the ball to the point of contact on the racquet and to cue themselves to keep the head still and hit the ball solidly. After practicing this cueing strategy for five weeks, the players showed marked improvements in both performance and technique.
**口头提示帮助熟练的执行者** 口头提示同样可以用于*提高技能熟练运动员的表现水平*。例如，Landin 和 Hebert （1999）让大学女子网球代表队的队员使用自我提示（self-cueing）的方法帮助她们提高空中球技术。队员被指导使用以下几个提示：首先是“分列”（split），用于提示她们跳跃呈双脚平衡制动，这样便于她们向任意方向移动；随后是“转身”（turn），提示自己将臀部和肩部转向球；最后是”击球“（hit），用以集中注意力追踪球直到其与球拍接触，并提醒自己保持头部不动，稳固地击球。练习这些策略 5 周后，队员在表现水平和技术方面都有显著的提高。

**The purposes of verbal cues.** The various uses of verbal cues just described indicate that verbal cues can be used for two different purposes. Sometimes the cue *directs attention* to a specific environmental event or to specific sources of regulatory information (in our example, “ready,” “ball,” and “hit” are such cues). In other cases, the cue *prompts action,* for either a specific movement (“head down”) or a sequence of movements (“turn”). The key to the effectiveness of verbal cues is that as the person practices and continues to use the cues, an association develops between the cue and the act it prompts. The benefit is that the person does not need to give attention to a large number of verbal instructions and can focus attention on the important perceptual and movement components of the skill. A question that remains to be addressed is whether these cues are most beneficial when they encourage an external focus of attention, regardless of whether they pertain to the environment or the movement (e.g., Wulf & Lewthwaite, 2016), or whether cues that encourage an internal or external focus of attention are equally effective.
**口头提示的目的** 从上述各种口头提示的使用方式中，可以总结出两个使用口头提示的目的。有时，提示*将注意力导向*特定的环境事件或规律性信息的特定来源（之前例子中的”准备“、”球“和“击球”等就属于此类线索）。另一种情况是，提示起到*提醒动作*的目的，这些动作可以是某一特定的运动（“头向下”）或一系列运动（“转身”）。有效口头提示的关键是，随着个体不断练习和使用这些提示，最终在提示与其提示的动作间建立起联系。这么做的好处是个体不再需要将注意力分配给冗长的口语指令，而是可以将注意力集中于技能的知觉和运动成分。一个有待解决的问题是，口头提示能发挥最大效用的时候是否就是这些提示促进外部注意力集中的时候，不管这些提示属于环境还是动作本身；或者说，促进内部注意力集中的提示是否和促进外部注意力集中的提示同样有效。

**SUMMARY**

In this chapter, we discussed demonstration and verbal instructions and cues as effective means of communicating information about how to perform motor skills.
本章我们探讨了传递执行运动技能信息的有效手段：示范、口授以及提示。

**Demonstration**
**示范**

A benefit of observing a skilled demonstration is that the observer detects the invariant characteristics of the movement pattern involved in the performance of the skill.
观察熟练示范的好处是，观察者可以从中了解到运动模式中相对不变的特征。

The point-light technique and research about what an observer perceives from a skilled demonstration shows that demonstration tends to be a more effective means of instruction when the skill being learned requires a new movement coordination than when it involves a new parameter of a well-learned coordination pattern.
光点技术的相关研究和探讨观察者从熟练的示范中感知到的内容的研究表明，当技能目标是习得新的运动协调模式而非更新已改变协调模式的参数时，示范的效果会更显著。

Observing a skill activates some of the same brain networks that are recruited when someone actually performs the skill.
观察技能示范时激活的某些神经网络和个体在实际执行这项技能时激活的神经网络相同。

Observation by a beginner of another beginner practicing a skill can facilitate skill learning.
初学者观察其他初学者的练习可以促进运动技能的学习。

Skills should be demonstrated several times before a beginner practices a skill, with additional demonstrations during practice as needed.
初学者在练习技能前应该观看数次该技能的示范；在练习过程中如果需要，也要提供示范。

Auditory forms of demonstration are effective for the learning of motor skills that have a specific overall movement time goal or require a specific rhythmic sequence or beat.
对于以特定动作时间为任务目标的技能以及要求按一定节奏进行一些列动作的技能来说，听觉形式的示范灰很有效。

Two prominent theoretical views that propose explanations for the benefit of demonstration on skill learning are
有两种主流理论可以解释示范对运动技能学习的促进作用，分别是：

The *cognitive mediation theory,* which proposes that observation of a demonstration leads to the development of a memory representation of the observed skill that the performer must access prior to performing the skill.
*认知调解理论*，主张观察示范可以形成技能的记忆表征，这是个体在执行技能前必须具有的。

The *dynamic view,* which proposes that people do not need cognitive mediation because the visual system can constrain the motor control system to act according to what has been observed.
*动力学观点*，主张个体不需要认知调解，因为视觉系统可以约束运动控制系统根据观察到的信息进行运动。

**Verbal Instructions and Cues**
**口授与提示**

Several attention-related factors are important to consider when using verbal instructions to communicate how to perform a motor skill:
使用口授来传递技能执行信息时，需要考虑几个与注意力相关的因素：

The amount of information included in verbal instructions should take into account learners’ attention-capacity limitations.
口授应该考虑到个体有限的注意力容量。

According to the action effect hypothesis, verbal instructions should direct the learner’s focus of attention to movement outcomes rather than to the movements themselves.
根据运动效果假说，口授应该将学习者的注意力导向运动结果，而不是运动本身。

Novice learners can learn invariant environmental context regulatory conditions without conscious awareness of them (i.e., implicit learning), although attention focus on the environmental context is important.
尽管将注意力集中于周边环境很重要，但是初学者可以在没有意识知觉的情况下，学习不变的环境条件（即隐式学习）。

Instructions influence the novice learner to direct attention to certain performance goals, which influences the strategies the learner uses to begin practicing a skill.
口授引导初学者将注意力集中于特定的表现目标，这会影响个体在开始执行技能时所使用的策略。

Verbal cues are short, concise phrases that serve to
口头提示是简短精炼的短语，用于：

Direct the performer’s attention to regulatory conditions in the environmental context.
将个体的注意力导向环境中的规律性条件。

Prompt key movement components of skills.
提醒技能中关键的动作部分

Verbal cues can be given by an instructor or the performer to
口头提示可以既可以由指导者给出，又可以由执行者给出，用于

Direct an observer’s attention during a demonstration of a skill.
在示范技能时引导个体的注意力

Direct a performer’s attention to critical parts of skills.
将执行者的注意力导向技能的关键部分

Prompt movements while performing a skill.
在执行技能时起到提醒的作用

**POINTS FOR THE PRACTITIONER**

Demonstrations by a skilled model have their greatest influence on skill learning when the skill requires the learning of a new movement coordination pattern.
当技能的学习目标时习得新的动作协调模式时，观察熟练示范者的示范对技能学习的影响最大。

People who are in the initial stage of learning a skill can benefit from observing others who are also novices. Consider using this strategy with large groups by having the people work in pairs where one practices the skill for several trials while the other observes, and then they switch roles.
处于技能学习初级阶段的学习者可以从观察其他初学者的动作中受益。在较大的团体中使用这种策略的方法是，让学习者两人一组，一人进行几次尝试，另一个人进行观察，然后让他们交换角色。

A demonstration by a skilled model can be done by the practitioner, a person in the group who can perform the skill well, or a skilled model on a video.
熟练示范的来源可以是指导者进行示范、小组中能够很好地执行该技能的人示范或播放熟练示范者的示范录像。

Frequent demonstrations result in better learning than less frequent demonstrations, especially in the initial stage of learning.
示范越多，学习效果越好，尤其是在学习的初始阶段。

Be certain that the people observing a demonstration can see the critical features of the skill being demonstrated.
确保观看示范的个体能够了解正在示范的技能的关键特征。

If visual and/or verbal cues are used with a demonstration, keep them simple and focused on the critical features of the skill that need to be emphasized. Avoid providing a running verbal commentary along with a demonstration.
如果要在示范中使用视觉和/或口头提示，请确保提示足够简练，并突出强调了技能的关键特征。避免在示范的同时不停地口头点评。

Use auditory cues to demonstrate timing and rhythm characteristics of skills.
利用听觉提示展示技能的时机和节奏特征。

Verbal instructions should present the minimum amount of information necessary to communicate what a person needs to do to perform a skill. Providing too much information in verbal instructions can be like providing no verbal instructions at all.
口头指令应该只提供个体为完成技能所必需的最少量的信息。如果在口头指令中提供了太多的信息，那么可能适得其反，一无所获。

Provide verbal instructions that focus attention on the outcome of a movement rather than on the movement itself.
提供的口头指令应该帮助学习者将注意力集中在动作的结果上，而不是动作本身。

When teaching open skills, verbal instructions should focus attention on areas in the environmental context where critical invariant regulatory conditions can be observed. Expect that the detection and perception of much of this critical information will occur without the person’s conscious awareness of what he or she perceives.
当教授开放性技能时，口头指令应该将学习者的注意力导向环境背景【】中包含可观察的重要不变调节条件的区域。同时也应注意学习者可以在意识层面没有觉知到的情况下识别和感知这些重要信息。

To ensure the detection and perception of critical invariant regulatory conditions, allow the person to perform the skill in a variety of environmental contexts and situations.
为了确保能识别和感知到重要的不变调节条件，应该让学习者在各种环境和情况下执行该技能。

Emphasize movement form rather than speed for a person’s initial practice attempts when teaching a speed-accuracy skill.
在教授快而准确技能时，在学习者的早起练习中，应该强调动作的准确性而不是速度。
