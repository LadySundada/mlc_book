{\fs18\expnd1\expndtw3 Many sport, recreation, fitness, and daily activities demonstrate our need to prepare the motor control system to carry out an intended action. For example, many sports events, such as running, swimming, and trap shooting, incorporate the importance of preparation into the rules of the activity by requiring an audible signal warning the competitors to get ready.}

{\fs18 Certain performance characteristics of activities also provide evidence of the need to prepare for the action. For example, when you decide to pick up a glass of water for a drink, there usually is a slight delay between your decision and the intended action. In another example, if you are driving a car along a street and another car unexpectedly pulls out in front of you, there is a measurable time delay between the moment you see this and the moment you begin to move your foot off the accelerator and onto the brake pedal. In each of these very different activity scenarios, the initial movement of the intended action is \u173 ?
preceded by an \u173 ?interval of time in which the motor control system is prepared according to the demands and constraints of the situation.\par }

{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2 The principle that the motor control system needs preparation before it can initiate an action has its\u8239 ?
roots in research carried out in the middle of the\u8239 ?nineteenth century by Donders (1868\'d01969), a Dutch physician. This principle is derived from an \u173 ?
inference based on the effects of various factors on\u8239 ?differences in the amount of time between the onset of a signal telling a person to begin performing a skill and the instant experimenters \u173 ?
actually observe the beginning of movement. As you read in chapter 2, we call this interval of time }{\*\cs61\fs20\b0\i\expnd0\expndtw-2
reaction time (RT).}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2  When considered in the context of action preparation, }{\*\cs61\fs20\b0\i\expnd0\expndtw-2

during this interval, we can gain some understanding of the action preparation processes our motor control system engages in to enable us to perform a skill.\par }

{\*\cs61\fs20\b0\i As the number of alternatives increases, the amount of time required to prepare the appropriate movement increases.}
{\fs20  The easiest way to demonstrate this relationship is by looking at the choice-RT situation you were introduced to in chapter 2. RT increases according to the number of stimulus or response choices. The fastest RTs occur in simple-RT situations, which involve no choices because they have only one stimulus and one response. RT slows down when more than one stimulus and more than one response are possible, as in the choice-RT situation.\par }

{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1 The relationship between the amount of RT \u173 ?increase and the number of response choices is so stable that a law, known as Hick\rquote s law, was developed that predicts a person}

Hick\rquote s law}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1  (Hick, 1952), which is sometimes referred to as the Hick-Hyman law, states that RT will increase logarithmically as the number of stimulus-response choices increases. This means that when we calculate the logarithm of the number of choices in a choice-RT situation and plot the resulting RT on a graph, RT increases linearly as the number of choices increases. The equation that describes this law is Choice RT }

decision involves eight choices; and so on. The number of bits indicates the smallest number of \ldblquote yes/no\rdblquote  \u173 ?
decisions needed to solve the problem created by the number of choices involved. For example, if eight choices were possible in a situation, a person would have to answer three yes/no questions to determine the correct choice. Thus, an eight-choice situation is a 3-bit decision situation. Accordingly, Hick\rquote s law not only correctly predicts that RT increases as the number of choice alternatives increases; it also predicts the specific size of increase to expect.\par }

participants could receive advance information (i.e., the \u173 ?precue) specifying the correct upcoming response for none, one, two, or all three of the dimensions. The results showed that as the number of precued \u173 ?

{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-3 An interesting twist to the precuing situation occurs \line when the advance information may or may not be correct. The critical factor influencing preparation time in this situation is the }
{\*\cs61\fs20\b0\i\expnd-1\expndtw-3 probability}{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-3  of the advance information\rquote s correctness. For example, if a basketball player is defending one-on-one against a player with the ball and knows that the player must either shoot or pass the ball, the defensive player has a 50\'d050 chance of guessing what the offensive player will do and preparing an appropriate action. But, if the defensive player knows that when the \u173 ?
offensive player is at that specific location on the\u8239 ?court, he or she will pass the ball 80 percent of the time, the defensive player will in all likelihood \u173 ?
begin to prepare to defend against the player passing the ball. In this situation, the advance information (i.e., the precue) provides the defensive player with an option that is better than 50\'d050. As a result, especially with only a 20 percent chance of making the wrong choice, the defensive player would \u173 ?
probably }{\*\cs61\fs20\b0\i\expnd-1\expndtw-3 bias}{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-3  his or her action preparation to defend against the player passing the ball.\par }

{\fs20 What advantage would the defensive player gain by biasing his or her preparation in this way? Would it be possible that this preparation bias might be a disadvantage? The }
{\fs20 answers}{\fs20  to these questions depend on whether the defensive player is correct or not in biasing his or her preparation. Research in laboratory settings provides evidence that shows the }
{\fs20 advantages and disadvantages}{\fs20  that can occur in situations like this one. The best example is an experiment by}{\fs20
 }{\fs20 Larish and Stelmach (1982), which has become the model approach to study this issue. Participants received advance information about whether the right hand or}
{\fs20  }{\fs20 the left hand should hit the target. But this information was correct only 20 percent, 50 percent, }{\fs20 \line }

{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2 An important principle of human performance is that the alertness of the performer influences the time he or she takes to prepare a required action, as well as the quality of the action itself. In two types of performance situations, the role of alertness is \u173 ?

{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw1 For RT tasks, a way to increase the likelihood that a person is optimally alert and prepared to \u173 ?respond appropriately is to provide some type of }
{\*\cs61\fs20\b0\i\expnd0\expndtw1 warning signal}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw1  that indicates he or she must respond within the next few seconds. Researchers demonstrated the benefit of this warning signal more than a century ago, in the early days of human performance research. In fact, there was sufficient evidence accumulated in the first half of the 1900s to conclude that RT is significantly faster when a warning signal precedes the signal to respond than when there is no warning signal (Teichner, 1954).}
{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw1 \par }{\fs20 An important point is that after the warning signal, there is an optimal length of time for the person to develop and maintain alertness while waiting for the go signal. If the go signal occurs too soon after the warning signal, or if the person must wait too long, RT will be longer than if the go signal occurs sometime between these two points in time. These performance effects indicate that people require a minimum amount of time to develop optimal alertness and that we can maintain that level of alertness for a limited amount of time.\par }
{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw0 As you can see in figure 8.4, there is an optimal time range during which the go signal should occur following the warning signal.

various muscles of both legs and the responding arm. The \u173 ?results showed that a specific sequence of supporting postural events occurred. For each movement \u173 ?

prior to}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1  the onset of the arm agonist muscles (biceps brachii). And as the arm velocity increased, the onset of the anticipatory postural muscle activity occurred at an earlier time prior to arm agonist \u173 ?
muscle activation. The authors also found different onset orders for the various postural muscles.}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1 \par }
{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-3 More recently, Bonnetblanc, Martin, and }{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-3\u173 ?}{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-3 Teasdale }
{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-3 \line }{\fs20 (2004) found that for an arm-pointing movement at different-sized targets (5, 10, and 25 cm wide) while standing, leg muscles not only activated before the arm began to move (similar to what Weeks and \u173 ?
Wallace found), but the amount of activation of specific muscles also varied according to the size of the target. For example, as target size decreased, EMG activity increased in the erector spinae but decreased in the tibialis \u173 ?
anterior and the rectus femoris of the quadriceps. When considered in relation to Fitts\rquote  law, which we discussed in chapter 7, these \u173 ?
results suggest that the relationship between movement time and movement accuracy demands has a basis in the preparation of the movements. In addition, these results provide \u173 ?
evidence of muscle preparation differences associated with the relationship between RT and movement accuracy as reported by Sidaway and others, which we considered earlier in this chapter.\par }
{\fs20\expnd1\expndtw5 Postural preparation effects have also been }{\fs20 shown for leg movements. For example, in a study by Mercer and Sahrmann (1999), people of three }
{\fs20\expnd1\expndtw3 age groups (8\'d012, 25\'d035, and 65}{\fs20\expnd1\expndtw3 \'d073 }{\fs20\expnd1\expndtw3 years}{\fs20\expnd1\expndtw3
), who \line }{\fs20\expnd1\expndtw6 had no neuromuscular impairments, performed }{\fs20 two types of stair-stepping movements: stepping onto a stair step with one foot \u173 ?
(the \ldblquote place task\rdblquote ) and stepping onto a stair step with one\u8239 ?foot and then putting the other foot on the step \u173 ?
(the \ldblquote step task\rdblquote ). The experimenters analyzed EMG recordings from four muscles of the stance leg }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\u173 ?
(tibialis anterior, gastrocnemius-soleus, hamstring,}{\fs20  and gluteus maximus) and two muscles of the \u173 ?moving leg (rectus femoris and gluteus maximus). When the experimenters analyzed the EMG results in terms of the onset (i.e., activation) times for each muscle for all participants, they found that the \u173 ?
tibialis anterior (TA) of the stance leg was the first }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1 muscle to activate. On average, it activated 215 msec}
{\fs20  }{\*\cs61\fs20\b0\i before}{\fs20  the initiation of movement by the opposite leg for the stepping task and 307 msec }{\*\cs61\fs20\b0\i
before}{\fs20  movement initiation for the place tasks. This initial activation of the TA in the stance leg ensured postural stability when the opposite leg stepped forward. Another important result of this experiment is the variety of muscle activation sequences demonstrated by each participant and across the participants for each task. Figure 8.5 shows the \u173 ?
specific muscle activation sequences exhibited for\u8239 ?the two tasks and the number of participants in}{\fs20\u8239 ?each age group who displayed each sequence on at least\u8239 ?
75 percent of the trials (which the experi}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2 menters \u173 ?referred to as representative of a \ldblquote preferred\rdblquote }
{\fs20  \u173 ?sequence). These results demonstrate that no specific sequence of muscle activation characterized all or any one of the participants for either task.\par }
{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw1 Finally, would you expect anticipatory postural adjustments to precede a simple movement like tapping your index finger on a tabletop while sitting in a chair? Two researchers in Italy (C}

{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1 Researchers have used this common everyday experience to provide evidence that the movement force characteristics are prepared in advance of the manipulation of objects. For example, Butler et al. (1993) showed that when men did not know the weight of a box that looked like it was filled with heavy objects, they performed with a jerking motion. Movement kinematics of these lifts showed that velocities at the shoulders and knees were much higher than the velocities when the men knew the actual weight of the box. In a }

{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2 Another example of the preparation of force control can be seen in handwriting. To prepare to write with a pen, a person needs to specify the amount of grip force on the pen as well as the amount of pressure to apply on the writing surface. Research (e.g., Wann }
{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2 & Nimmo-Smith, 1991) has shown that experienced writers adjust the amount of pen pressure on the writing surface according to the characteristics of the surface to allow energy-efficient, continuous, \u173 ?

For example, if you want to pick up a cup that is upside down on a table so that you can fill the cup with water, you will probably pick up the cup with the grip that will be most comfortable when you place the cup upright in order to fill it, even if this grip feels rather awkward when you initially grasp the cup.\par }

{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-3 The typically spontaneous grasp position based on the final position of the hand when the object is used in its intended way is a phenomenon known as the end-state}
{\*\cs61\fs20\b0\i\expnd-1\expndtw-3  comfort effect.}{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-3  Stated simply, this effect is \ldblquote the tendency to take hold of an object in an awkward posture to permit a more comfortable, or more easily controlled, final posture once the object is brought to its target position\rdblquote  (Zhang & Rosenbaum, 2008, }
{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-3 \line }{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-3 p. 383).

{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1 & Caldwell, 1996; Short & Cauraugh, 1999). This explanation proposes that precision in limb positioning will be greater, the movement will be faster, }
{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1 and control over the object will be better}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1  when a person\rquote s limb is in a comfortable position. Thus, to ensure a faster and more accurate final limb and \u173 ?
object position, a person prepares movement characteristics according to the comfort of the final rather than the starting position of the limb. Although this strategy may require some awkward hand and arm postures when picking up an object, it enables the person to more effectively and efficiently achieve the object manipulation goal. Interestingly, people will choose their non-dominant hand over their dominant hand to perform a task if the end-state comfort will be higher for their non-dominant hand (Coelho, Studenka, & Rosenba}

{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1 that the kinematic characteristics of hand and finger movements during typing and piano playing and the lips, tongue, and jaw during speaking are modified by what elements in the sequence of movements come before or after them.}
{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1  (e.g., \u173 ?Engel, Flander}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1 s, &}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1  Soechting, 1997; Soechting & Flanders, 1992). For example, in the Engel et al. study, skilled pianists played short \u173 ?

{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1  In one piece, the first four notes }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1 ascended and the next two notes descended. Pianists typically play the first note in this phrase with the thumb, the next note with the index finger, and continue until the fourth note is played with the ring finger. As the phrase descends, the pianists use the same fingers in reverse order. In a second version of the phrase, the first four notes ascended, as before, but the next two notes continued to ascend. Pianists will now reposition the hand after the third note so that the fourth note is played with the thumb and the remaining two notes are played with the index finger followed by the middle finger.}
{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1  }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2 Two aspects of the results provided evidence for movement preparation in advance. First, the high consistency of the timing of key depresses and releases and the hand and finger kinematics within each pianist suggested advance preparation. Second, the timings and movement kinematics of the phrase that descended were different from those when the phrase continued to ascend and the differences were apparent from as early as the second note onward. So, even though the first three notes were identical and were played with the same fingers, their timings and kinematics were modified for the second variation of the phrase in anticipation of repositioning the hand so that the fourth note could be played with the thumb. In other words, the first few notes of the two phrases were prepared in distinct ways even though these notes were identical and were played with the same fingers.}

{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw2 The Southard and Amos (1996) study will serve as a good example of how these researchers have determined that such a relationship exists.

Each video recording was analyzed to determine the preperformance behaviors each participant used on each trial. The types of behaviors for each activity are listed in table 8.1. It is important to note that although each of the behaviors was observed, individual participants did not exhibit every behavior. The researchers also analyzed the total time to perform the ritual and the relative time for each behavior in the ritual, which was the percentage of time engaged in each behavior in the ritual. Results showed a moderately high .77 correlation between the relative time for the ritual behaviors and successful performance. This relationship suggests that the consistent relative timing of preperformance ritual behaviors may be an important part of the successful performance of closed motor skills that provide an opportunity for the performer to engage in preperformance rituals.}
{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw2 \par }{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-5 Mack (2001) provided additional evidence that the consistent performance of the components of a preperformance routine is more important than the total amount of time taken to perform the routine.

{\fs20 In a study by Cotterill, Sanders, and Collins (2010), elite golfers in England (handicap range of 0\'d02) were interviewed about their preperformance routines.

{\fs18 The study of reaction time (RT) as an indicator of mental operations has a history that can be traced back to the middle of the nineteenth century. Scientists were becoming interested in determining the \u173 ?
basic elements of thought. The investigation of RT provided a useful means of investigating this question because it represented the time interval between the detection of a stimulus and the initiation of a response to it. Dr. F. C. Donders, a Dutch physician, hypothesized that specific mental operations occur in a \u173 ?
specific series of stages during the RT interval and was certain that he could identify each stage. He initiated research that was published in 1868 (Donders, 1868\'d01969) and continues to influence researchers \u173 ?

This is one reason professional athletes and sporting teams are increasingly employing analysts to scout their opponents before matches. Knowing in advance what your opponents are likely to do in specific situations provides you with a major advantage in responding to their actions. Of course, your opponents can also use this information to their advantage by doing the opposite of what you expect them to do!

{\fs18 Loken et al. (1995) provided evidence for this difficulty by comparing patients with severe closed-head injuries to non-brain-injured people. All participants observed on a computer screen sets of two, four, or eight small blue circles (1.5 mm diameter).

{\fs18 Changing from a sitting posture to a standing posture (referred to as a sit-to-stand action) is a common everyday activity that provides a good example of how the motor control system adapts to allow the same action to occur from a variety of initial postural positions. Shepherd and Gentile (1994) presented evidence of this adaptability by having healthy adults sit in different postures on a chair (an erect trunk, a fully flexed trunk, and a partially flexed trunk, i.e., flexed between the fully flexed and erect positions), and then stand. Analyses of the various joint movements involved in this action showed this:\par }

{\fs18 These different initiation patterns of joint movements illustrate how functional demands influence the order of muscle activation in preparing an action. Because different sitting postures will require different support, propulsion, and balance characteristics during the sit-to-stand action, the order of the initiation of movement of the knee or hip joints is a critical factor in enabling a person to carry out the intended action without losing balance.\par }

{\fs18 Often overlooked in the study of motor learning and control is the role of motivation to perform a skill. A motivational variable known as }
{\*\cs61\fs18\b0\i performance expectancies,}{\fs18  which refers to a performer\rquote s expectations of how he or she will perform a skill, is particularly relevant to the action preparation process.

{\*\cs61\fs18\b0\i efficiency}{\fs18  referring to the amount of energy used to perform a skill, i.e., lower energy use indicates higher efficiency). In addition to presenting an experiment designed to test their performance expectancy effect hypothesis, the authors also provide an excellent review of research describing the motivational effects of various forms of influencing expectancies for both novice and skilled performers. }
{\fs18 It is important to note here that this same performance expectancy phenomenon was discussed as an essential part of the OPTIMAL theory of motor learning, which we discussed in chapter 5.}
