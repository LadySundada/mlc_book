{\fs18\expnd0\expndtw-1 There are a variety of ways to measure motor skill \u173 ?performance. A useful way to organize the many types of motor performance measures is by \u173 ?
creating two categories related to different levels of perfor\u173 ?mance observation. These categories map onto the different levels of analysis\'d1actions, \u173 ?
movements, and neuromotor processes\'d1that were introduced in \u173 ?chapter\'ca1. }{\fs18\expnd0\expndtw-1 We will call the first category \u173 ?}

{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2 The stimulus (or \ldblquote go\rdblquote ) signal is the indication to act. In laboratory or clinical settings, the signal can take one of a variety of forms, such as a light, }
{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2 a buzzer, a shock, a word on a screen, or a spoken word or sound. As such, the signal can relate to any sensory system\'d1vision, hearing, or touch. The person can be required to perform any type of movement. For example, the person might be required to lift a finger off a telegraph key, depress a keyboard key, speak a word, kick a board, or walk a step. Finally, to assess optimal RT, some type of warning signal should be given prior to the stimulus signal.\par }

{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-4 Reaction time has a long history as a popular mea\u173 ?sure of human motor skill performance. Although RT can be used as a performance measure to assess how quickly a person can initiate a required movement, researchers and practitioners also use it as a basis for inferring other characteristics related to performing a motor skill.}
{\*\cs60\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-4\super 1}{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-4  The most common is to identify the environmental context information a person may use while preparing to produce a required action, which will be the topic of discussion in chapter 8. For example, if one performance situation results in a longer RT than another situation, the researcher can determine what may have led to the different RT lengths, which then can tell us something about influences on the amount of time it takes us to prepare an action. In chapter 8 you will study several ways that researchers use RT as a\u8239 ?
performance measure to investigate how we prepare to perform a motor skill and the factors that \u173 ?influence this preparation.\par }

{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw0 Another use of RT is to assess the capabilities of a person to anticipate a required action and determine when to initiate it. In a sport situation, a basketball coach may want to know how long it takes a point guard to recognize that the defender\rquote s actions indicate the guard should pass the ball rather than shoot it.

{\fs20 When a situation involves only one signal and requires only one movement in response, the RT situation is known as }{\*\cs57\fs20\b\i0\expnd0\expndtw-1
simple RT}{\fs20 . In the example presented in figure 2.2, the person must lift a finger from the keyboard key when a light comes on. Another type of RT situation is }
{\*\cs57\fs20\b\i0\expnd0\expndtw-1 choice RT}{\fs20 , where there is more than one signal to which the person must respond, and each signal has a specified response. The example in figure 2.2 indicates that the person must respond to the red light by lifting the index finger from a keyboard key, to the blue light by lifting the middle finger from a different key, and\u8239 ?
to the green light by lifting the ring finger from a third key. The third type of RT situation is }{\*\cs57\fs20\b\i0\expnd0\expndtw-1

indicator of }{\*\cs59\fs20\b0\i perceptual and cognitive decision-making activity}{\fs20  in which the person engages while preparing an action.

Velocity is always presented on a graph as a position-by-time curve (see figure 2.7, \line in which the velocity curve is based on the same movement as the displacement curve).

{\fs20 Because the light wavelengths used by NIRS can penetrate the skull, the technique has also been used to assess brain activity. Scientists who study the brain are particularly interested in the technique because it is inexpensive and portable, potentially providing big advantages over the more established measures of brain activity, which are covered in the next section of the chapter. NIRS has some disadvantages, however, that have left many questioning its ultimate value as a technique for measuring brain activity. For example, the light probes cannot penetrate very deeply into the brain before the light is scattered and the path-length of a given wavelength of light is not well known for different types of tissue. Consequently, NIRS is limited to providing information about the outermost layer of the brain, the cortex. In addition, it has a limited spatial resolution. NIRS still has the advantage of being portable; an advantage that is particularly important for movement scientists because it enables brain activity to be measured while a participant is moving. Even that advantage may be fading, however, as researchers develop new ways to remove movement-related artifacts from the signals collected by more traditional measures of brain activity, like EEG (Kline, Huang, Snyder, & Ferris, 2015}

{\*\cs59\fs20\b0\i delta waves,}{\fs20  which are characteristic of deep sleep. In general, mental activity generates the fast beta waves, while nondreaming sleep and coma produce slow theta waves.\par In the study of motor skill performance, researchers have used EEG to investigate several \u173 ?
issues (see Hatfield & Hillman, 2001, }{\fs20 Hatfield, Haufler, Hung, & Spalding, 2004, and Holmes & Wright, 2017}{\fs20 , for reviews of this research literature).

{\fs20 One of the limitations of EEG as a technique for assessing brain activity is that it is limited to activity in the brain cortex surface and does not show the anatomical structures that are active in specific brain regions. The development of }

Developed in the 1970s, PET scans show blood flow or metabolic activity in the brain and provide a window into all areas of the brain. The technique involves the injection into the bloodstream, or the inhalation, of a radioactive solution in which atoms emit positively charged electrons (i.e., positrons). Interaction of the positrons with electrons in the blood produces photons of electromagnetic radiation. The locations of these positron-emitting atoms can then be found by a scanner in which detectors pick up the photons\rquote  locations in the brain (see Bear, Connors, & Paradiso, 2001, for further \u173 ?
details). Computer programs then analyze levels of activity of the photons in brain neurons. Increased activity \ldblquote lights up\rdblquote  the brain area; the computer programs capture and produce images of these \u173 ?

{\fs20  The assessment is a variation of the EEG (notice the \ldblquote encephalography\rdblquote  similarity).

One of MEG\rquote s advantages for researchers is that it provides a direct measure of brain function; this differs from other brain measures such as fMRI and PET that are secondary measures because brain activity is assessed on the basis of brain metabolism. MEG provides very high temporal resolution, which makes it especially useful for the identification of damaged brain tissue; this is critical for both diagnosis and surgical purposes, as well as for observing brain activity during the performance of cognitive and motor activities. The recording system for MEG involves the use of sensors that detect magnetic fields in the brain that result from neuronal activity. The spatial distributions of these fields are analyzed and used to determine the location of the activity. Researchers commonly combine results from MEG with those from EEG and MRI. The addition of the MEG results provides more accurate localization of the active brain structures associated with the activity in which the subject is engaged. \par }

{\fs20 Many motor skills involve movements that are cyclic. This means that they repeat a movement pattern for a certain amount of time, such as \u173 ?
walking or running (the step-cycle in gait in \u173 ?figure\u8239 ?2.8 is an example of a cyclic movement). These types of\u8239 ?
skills are especially interesting because they \u173 ?provide a quantifiable means of measuring \u173 ?coordination. This is accomplished by calculating the \u173 ?
relative phase between two limb segments or limbs during one cycle, or part of a cycle, of the skill. A }{\*\cs59\fs20\b0\i phase}
{\fs20  of a cyclic movement refers to a \u173 ?specific point on the cycle. Because any point on the cycle involves both a spatial position of a limb or limb segment and a point in time, the movements of the\u8239 ?
limb or limb segment can be described by a \u173 ?displacement-velocity graph that portrays the \u173 ?relationship between the spatial and temporal characteristics of the movements. This graph, which is called a }
{\*\cs59\fs20\b0\i phase plot}{\fs20  (or }{\*\cs59\fs20\b0\i phase portrait}{\fs20 ), presents the limb or limb segment\rquote s angular displacement on one axis and its angular velocity on the other axis. When a cyclic movement is graphed in this way, the result is a graph like the one in figure 2.12, which is based on the movement of a leg segment during the stance portion of a step cycle (from the heel strike of one foot to the toeoff of the same foot). The data points on the phase plot are the X-Y coordinates sampled at specific times in the movement analysis (e.g., if the sampling rate is 100 Hz, there will be 100 X-Y coordinate data points). The calculation of a movement\rquote s phase is complex and will not be \u173 ?

{\*\cs59\fs20\b0\i phase angle}{\fs20  for that point in time of the movement. One way that researchers use phase angles to assess movement coordination is by comparing the phase angles of two limb segments, or limbs, at a specific point in time. This comparison establishes the }

{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1 In addition to using relative phase as an index of coordination between limb segments, researchers commonly use it to describe the relationship between two arms or two legs, or between one arm and one leg. For example, the two legs are }

{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2 An essential element in understanding motor learning is the measurement of motor performance. All concepts presented in this text are based on research in which researchers observed and measured motor performance.

students or patients as they progress through \u173 ?practice and therapy regimes. In this chapter, we \u173 ?focused on different ways to measure motor performance, along with the ways we can use these measurements in \u173 ?

{\fs18\expnd1\expndtw5 An offensive lineman in football must perform his assignment as quickly as possible after the center snaps the ball. If the lineman is consistently slow in carrying out his assignment, the problem could be that he is not giving enough attention to the ball snap, he is not sure about his assignment, or he moves too slowly when carrying out his assignment. The first two problems relate to RT (the time between the ball snap and the beginning of the lineman\rquote s foot movement); the third relates to MT (the time between the beginning of foot movement and the completion of the assignment). By assessing both RT and MT in an actual situation, the coach could become more aware of the reason for the lineman\rquote s problem and begin working on helping the lineman improve that specific part of the problem.\par }
