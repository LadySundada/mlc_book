{\fs18\expnd0\expndtw2 Before beginning the discussion of these sensory systems, it is important to point out that the limiting of this chapter to these three senses should not be interpreted as suggesting that they are the only senses \u173 ?
involved in motor control. We know from the research literature (e.g., Huber, Stathopoulos, & \u173 ?Sussman, 2004) that auditory sensory information is especially important for speech production; and anecdotal evidence from skilled athletes describes the importance of auditory information for influencing their behavior, such as determining the ball flight characteristics of a batted ball in baseball and a serve or ground stroke in tennis. In addition, research (e.g., Guerraz & Day, 2005) has shown the important role of the vestibular system of the inner ear in the control of balance and possibly arm-trunk coordination during trunk-assisted reaching movements (Mars, \u173 ?
Archambault, & Feldman, 2003), although both also involve the tactile, proprioception, and \u173 ?vision sensory systems. The vestibular system also seems to play a role in the representation of external space (Borel et al., 2014). However, for purposes of this chapter, which is to introduce you to the involvement of the sensory systems in motor control, we will limit our discussion to touch, proprioception, and vision.}

{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-4 Researchers generally agree that touch plays an im\u8209 ?\line portant role in the performance of a variety of types of motor skills and motor control processes. We will briefly consider five movement-related characteristics influenced by tactile sensory information the CNS receives from touch. First, a predominant characteristic is }
{\*\cs47\fs20\b0\i\expnd-1\expndtw-4 movement accuracy,}{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-4  which decreases when tactile information is not available, especially at the fingertips. Research has demonstrated poorer accuracy when tactile feedback is removed or minimized for several skills including pointing (Rao & \line }
{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-5 Gordon, 2001), reaching and grasping \u173 ?(Gentilucci, Toni, Daprati, & \u173 ?Gangitano, 1997), typing on a \u173 ?
keyboard (Gordon & Soechting, 1995; Rabin & Gordon, 2004), maintaining a precision grip (Fisher, Galea, Brown, }{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-5
& Lemon, 2002), rhythmically tapping a finger to an auditory stimulus (Pollok, M}{\*\cs48\f9\fs20\b0\i0\expnd-1\expndtw-5 \'9f}{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-5
ller, Ascherleben, Schnitzler, & Prinz, 2004), and playing a sequence of notes on a piano (Goebl & Palmer, 2008). In most of these studies, the researchers anesthetized the fingertips so that tactile afferent information would not be available, which provided the opportunity to compare movement accuracy to performance with no anesthesia. A different approach to determining the role of tactile afferent information in motor control is to add touch to the performance of an activity. For example, in the experiment by Rao and Gordon }
{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-3 (2001), participants increased their pointing accuracy when they reproduced a pointing movement to\u8239 ?
a target they had touched compared to when they moved their arm to the target location without touching it.}{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-3
 A slightly different approach revealed that participants made more accurate and more consistent reaches with the index finger on one hand to the unseen index finger on the other hand, when a brief vibrotactile stimulus was applied to the target index finger (Mikula et al., 2018).}

performance before and after anesthetizing}{\fs20  }{\fs20 a}{\fs20  }{\fs20 finger. They showed that without tactile sensory feedback from the finger, not only did typing accuracy decrease, as described above, but movement consistency from one trial to another also decreased. Third, }
{\*\cs47\fs20\b0\i movement timing}{\fs20  can be influenced by tactile feedback}{\fs20 , particularly in rhythmic movements that involve intermittent contact with the environment, like juggling and locomotion (Ankarali, Sen, De, Okamura, & Cowan, 2014)}
{\fs20 . For example, experiments by Zelaznik and colleagues have shown that including a tactile event (e.g., a velcro strip at the top of the circle) as a timing cue improved timing accuracy for }
{\fs20 continuous }{\fs20 circle drawing when a criterion time for completing the circle was required (e.g., Studenka, Zelaznik, & Balasubramaniam, 2012).\par }
{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw0 Fourth, }{\*\cs47\fs20\b0\i\expnd0\expndtw0 movement force adjustments}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw0  while holding and using an object also depend on tactile feedback. For example, when you grasp a cup and}

cup to your mouth and properly position the cup\u8239 ?to drink from it. Evidence for the role played by tactile sensory feedback in adjusting grip forces during movement has been reported in several \u173 ?
studies (e.g., Gysin, Kaminski, & Gordon, 2003; Nowak & Hermsdorfer, 2003}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw0 ; White, 2015}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw0
; White et al., 2018}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw0 ).

All participants were able to perceive, control, and learn the reaching movements, however, the neuropathy patients were slower to notice the perturbations when visual feedback was unavailable, and slower and more variable in their compensations to the perturbations. One of the most notable findings was the large individual differences between the three patients in terms of their learning of the reaching movements.

{\fs20 Our own personal experiences as well as research evidence tells us that of all our sensory systems, we tend to use and trust vision the most. For example, when you first learned to type or play the piano, you undoubtedly felt that if you could not see your fingers hit each key, you could not perform accurately. Beginning dancers and stroke patients learning to walk have a similar problem. They often act as if they cannot perform the activity if they cannot watch their feet.\par }

{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-4 These anecdotal experiences illustrate our tendency to give vision a predominant role when we perform motor skills. Research evidence also supports this phenomenon. The best example is a \u173 ?
classic experiment by Lee and Aronson (1974) that is often referred to as the \ldblquote moving room\rdblquote  experiment. Infants stood in a room in which the walls could move forward and backward. However, the floor was stationary and did not\u8239 ?
move. In this sensory conflict situation, the infants\rquote  vision indicated they were moving, but their proprioceptors indicated they were not. The \u173 ?
researchers observed the infants\rquote  postural \u173 ?responses to the movement of the walls. When the walls moved, the children made posture correction adjustments that were in keeping with trying to maintain their standing balance as if the floor were moving. But because the floor did not move, their proprioceptors were not signaling that their bodies were losing stability. Only their visual systems detected any loss of balance. }

{\fs20 \par }{\fs20 Central and peripheral vision also play different roles in locomotion.

The information received through \u173 ?
peripheral vision during locomotion is particularly important to help people maintain their action goal without being affected by pathway problems, such as obstacles, other people, or irregular steps on a stairway.}

In a study that combined prehension and locomotion, Graci (2011) had participants pick up a full glass of water on a table located at the end of their walking path and move the glass to a new location on the table. They performed this task with either full vision of their lower body, the table and glass, and with occluded vision, which prevented them from using peripheral vision to see the table and their lower body when they reached the table. They could always see the glass of water. One of the effects of not having peripheral vision available was the time to contact the glass, which was calculated from the end of their last step until their hand reached the glass, Without the availability of peripheral vision, they increased their time to contact the glass by approximately 40 percent.\par }
{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-3 One of the most important sources of information available to peripheral vision for controlling actions is }
{\*\cs50\fs20\b\i0\expnd0\expndtw-1 optical flow}{\fs20 .}{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-3  Optical flow refers to the moving pattern of rays of light that strikes the retina of the eye from all parts of the environment. The word \ldblquote flow\rdblquote  is significant because it indicates the dynamic nature of this visually detected information. When our head moves through the environment, whether through head turning, postural sway, or locomotion, our visual system detects and uses patterns of optical flow that covary precisely with the speed and direction of our head motion. Similarly, movement of an object, a person, or a surface provides the visual system with a different pattern of optical flow that specifies the direction and speed with which that particular feature of the environment is moving. Differentiating the various patterns of optical flow allows us to effectively control posture, locomotion, and object manipulation and to coordinate our actions with the regulatory conditions in the environment.

{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1 One of the ways researchers have determined this coordination characteristic is by pairing the eye movement recording technique, which we discussed in the preceding section, with the motion analysis technique discussed in chapter 2. Although \u173 ?
perception-action coupling can involve any movement (an excellent example is the visual-postural coupling described earlier in Lee & Aronson\rquote s [1974] moving room experiment), we will focus here on the coupling of vision and hand movements.\par }

{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2 A good example of research evidence that demonstrates the coupling between vision and hand movement is an experiment by Helsen, Elliott, Starkes, and Ricker (1998). Participants moved their index fingers 40 cm to the right from a starting location in front of them to a 1 cm by 2 cm target as fast as \line \u173 ?
possible. Both point of gaze and hand movements tended to undershoot the target and then made one or more corrections to hit the target. The analysis of eye and finger movements showed that the participants typically initiated eye movements approximately 70\u8239 ?

{\*\cs47\fs20\b0\i\expnd0\expndtw-2 temporal coupling}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2  between the eye movements and hand movements because the completion of the initial eye movement coincided with the timing of the peak acceleration of the hand movement. Evidence for }
{\*\cs47\fs20\b0\i\expnd0\expndtw-2 spatial coupling}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2  was shown by the point of gaze consistently terminating on the target when the hand movement was at 50 percent of the total movement distance.\par }
{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw0 Since that experiment, the same researchers (Helsen, Elliott, Starkes, & Ricker, 2000) showed that the initiation of elbow and shoulder movements is also coupled in time with eye and finger movement initiation. The sequence of events was that the eyes moved first, followed by the shoulder, then the elbow, and finally the finger. On every trial for every participant, the point of gaze was on the target long before the hand arrived at the target. }
{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw0 Similar coupling effects have been demonstrated for vision and feet during locomotion. For example, researchers have shown that people with vision gaze }

Researchers have been attempting to answer this question for more than 100 years, beginning with research by Woodworth in 1899. The most vigorous effort to investigate this question \u173 ?
occurred in the latter part of the twentieth century, beginning with an influential experiment by Keele and Posner }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1

Elliott, Helsen, & Chua, 2001, for excellent reviews of this research). Part of the problem is that different experimental procedures have resulted in a variety of time estimates for the processing of visual feedback.\par }
{\fs20 The most common experimental procedure has been to have people perform manual aiming movements with different goal movement times. On some trials, the lights would go out just as the person \u173 ?
began to move, whereas on other trials the lights \u173 ?remained on. The logic to this procedure was that if visual feedback were necessary, aiming accuracy would decrease with the lights out because the person could not see the target and therefore would not be able to use visual feedback. When participants did not know when the lights would be on or off, the amount of time to process visual feedback was estimated to be between 190 and 260 msec. However, later experiments used the same lights-\u173 ?
on-or-off technique, but participants knew when they would perform under each condition (e.g., Elliott & Allard, 1985; Zelaznik, Hawkins, & \u173 ?
Kisselburgh, 1983). This advance knowledge indicated that visual feedback could be used in less than 100 msec.}{\fs20 \par }{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-3

 \line }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2 These have included such procedures as distorting the visual information by having people wear prism glasses (e.g., Smith & Bowen, 1980, \u173 ?
estimated the time to be about 150 msec); moving the target location after the person initiated a movement to a target (e.g., Brenner & Smeets, 1997, 2009, \u173 ?
estimated the time to be between 110 and 150 msec); and preventing visual feedback for portions of the distance to the target (e.g., Spijkers & Lochner, 1994, estimated the time to be about 135\u8239 ?

{\fs18\expnd0\expndtw-2 Researchers have investigated the role of proprioception for the performance of gymnastics skills by blocking or distorting vision while the gymnast performs. Although this method is an indirect method, since all other sensory systems except vision function normally, the movement accuracy results of experiments that have used this technique correspond with those described in this chapter in which proprioception was directly blocked or distorted. The following three experiments are some examples of the use of distorting or blocking the vision of gymnasts while they performed skills commonly used in gymnastics events.\par }

{\fs18 Robertson and Elliott (1996) distorted the vision of skilled gymnasts as they walked on a balance beam. The results showed that the gymnasts increased the number of steps they used to walk as fast as possible along the beam and increased their movement form errors.\par }

{\fs18 A person sits at a table while looking at a realistic life-size rubber hand on the tabletop. The person\rquote s own hand is out of view, either placed under the table or covered by a screen. The experimenter uses two small paintbrushes to simultaneously brush the person\rquote s hand and the rubber hand. An important part of creating the illusion is to synchronize the timing of the brushings. After several repeated brushings of the two hands, the person experiences the illusion that he or she can feel the brush strokes on the rubber hand as if it were his or her own. In fact, subjects have often spontaneously reported that the rubber hand feels like it is their own hand. Thus the pairing of the visual observation of the brushing of the rubber hand with the tactile sensation of the brushing of the real hand results in a perception that the visually observed rubber hand is part of the person. Interestingly, Botvinick and Cohen (1998) showed that part of the illusion involves a distortion of proprioceptive information when a moving of the rubber hand\rquote s position gets reported by the person as a moving of his or her own hand.}

{\fs18 Two researchers in Belgium (Lenoir & Mazyn, 2005) studied ten experienced discus throwers to determine the visual contributions of central and peripheral vision during the throw. The throwers made throws with full vision, peripheral vision only, central vision only, and no vision. Results showed that throws were significantly shorter with only central and no vision available compared to throws with full and peripheral vision. These results demonstrate that peripheral vision provides essential information to allow the thrower to maintain control of the rotation of his or her body during the throw.\par }
