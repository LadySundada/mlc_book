{\fs18 Why do we practice a skill? One reason is to in\u8209 ?\line crease our capability of performing the skill in a situation requiring it. We want to be able to accomplish specific action goals when we need to, whether we perform everyday skills, work skills, or sport skills. For example, if you were a physical therapist working with the gait problems of a stroke \u173 ?
patient, you would want that person to be able to walk in environments outside the clinic. The patient should be able to walk at home, in the workplace, at the grocery store, in the mall, etc. Similarly, if you were an athletic trainer, it would be essential for you to prepare the injured athlete you are rehabilitating to perform his or her sport skills in competition. And if you were a basketball coach, you would want your players to play well in games as well as in practice. Each of these examples involves the concept of transfer of learning, because of the need to transfer learned capabilities in one environment or situation to a different environment or situation. In fact, one of the goals of practicing a skill is developing the }
{\fs18\u173 ?}{\fs18 capability }{\fs18 to transfer performance of the skill from the practice environment to some other environment in which the individual must perform the skill so that he or she can achieve the same action goal. Another concern for the practitioner is whether the learning of a new skill will be facilitated or impeded by skills that have already been acquired. A physical educator might wonder whether learning to gallop will interfere with or facilitate learning to skip or whether learning to throw a baseball will influence learning to bowl a cricket ball, for example. Teachers, coaches, and therapists encounter these types of questions frequently.}

example, a person who has learned the forehand in tennis before learning the forehand in badminton often experiences some initial negative transfer for learning the mechanics of the stroke.

{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw2 Predicting whether transfer will be positive, negative, or zero is difficult. For example, Karen Adolph (1997) found that what infants learned about negotiating risky slopes when they were learning to crawl showed no transfer to negotiating slopes when they started to walk. The infants learned to avoid risky slopes as they accrued crawling experience; however, they plunged head-first down the same risky slopes when they started to walk. In essence, the infants had to learn all over again how to negotiate the risky slopes from their new walking posture. Adolph (1997, 2000) argued that the mapping of perceptual information onto action control strategies was posture specific, with new skills requiring new mappings (see Witherington et al., 2005, for a discussion of the potential limits of this specificity of learning effect). Interestingly, experience with falls, inside and outside the laboratory, did not predict how quickly infants learned to avoid risky slopes when learning to crawl and walk. Rather, some general aspect of crawling experience contributed to the infants\rquote  increased skill at determining what slopes they could and could not traverse. Though it is unclear whether these counterintuitive findings generalize beyond the very early development of motor skills, the findings highlight the intriguing nature of the study of motor skill transfer.\par }

{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-4 Gentile\rquote s taxonomy of motor skills (discussed in chapter 1) provides a good example of how the transfer principle can be implemented in any skill training situation. That taxonomy presents sixteen categories of skills, systematically sequenced from less to more complex according to specific skill characteristics (see table 1.1). We highlighted that one use for the taxonomy was to guide the selection of a functionally appropriate sequence of activities during clinical rehabilitation. Gentile based this taxonomy on the principle of positive transfer. She organized the sequence of activities by listing first the activities that a person must perform before performing more complex or difficult ones. The therapist can select appropriate functional activities for a rehabilitation regime by starting with activities related to the taxonomy \u173 ?
category in which the therapist identified the skill performance deficit. Then the therapist can increase activity complexity by progressing through the taxonomy from that point, as described in chapter 1.\par }

{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2 Gentile\rquote s taxonomy can also be used to develop skill progressions in coaching and physical education contexts. For example, a surfing instructor might \line use dry land drills when teaching students how to paddle and stand up on a board, before letting them try the skills in the water. The instructor assumes that there will be positive transfer from the dry land drills to the performance of the skills in water.\par }

Students in an experimental group were given five skateboarding lessons before joining a control group for a six-day snowboarding trip. Expert video-based ratings of performance revealed no significant group differences on the second day of snowboarding practice; however, the students who had received prior skateboarding practice significantly outperformed the control students on the sixth day of practice. Clearly, then, something that was learned during skateboarding practice transferred to snowboarding, though it was interesting to see that the benefits were not realized during the very early days of snowboarding practice.\par }
{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-4 There are numerous other examples of incorporating the transfer principle in instructional settings. It is common, for example, to practice a part of a skill before practicing the entire skill (we will discuss this practice method in chapter 18). Sometimes an instructor simplifies an activity for a person before requiring the person to perform the skill in its actual context; for example, the coach has a person hit a baseball from a batting tee before hitting a moving ball.

Virtual reality training, an immersive form of simulator training that relies on the transfer of learning principle, is becoming increasingly popular in a range of different contexts, including sports, surgery, rehabilitation, and police and military training.

{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2 An important question concerning the similarity of skill components is this: What constitutes a component part? There are two answers to this question. One is any observable movement part of a skill, such as an overarm movement or a ball striking movement, which could be quantified kinematically. The degree of similarity in the kinematic profiles should provide the most accurate predictions about the potential degree of transfer across skills. For example, both baseball pitching and football passing include overarm throwing movements that are somewhat similar when compared in terms of observable movement, but become decidedly less similar when compared on the basis of their kinematics. The kinematic difference between these skills was nicely demonstrated in a study of high school and college baseball pitchers and football quarterbacks (Fleisig et al., 1996). }
{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2 However, students in a physical education course showed that practicing fundamental overarm throwing for several classes yielded positive transfer benefits for learning both an overhead clear in badminton and the javelin throw (O\rquote Keefe, Harrison, & Smyth, 2007).\par }
{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2 Bernstein (1996) had a slightly different take on the components that transfer from one skill to another. He argued that }
{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2 transfer}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2  of learning was based on the use of earlier elaborated automatisms. Recall from chapter 12 that automatisms are background corrections to motor skills that can be considered independent skills in their own right. Bernstein thought that the }
{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2 amount}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2  of transfer from one skill to another was not based on kinematic similarity but on }
{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2 the similarity of}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2  groups of background corrections. For example, he maintained that little transfer would be expected from playing a violin to sawing or filing because of dissimilarities in the required background corrections. Even though the }
{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2 kinematics}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2  of the bow, saw, and file may look similar, the forces acting on each implement would be quite different and so the similarity would be achieved by regulating quite different patterns of muscular forces}
{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2  }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2 that would require different background corrections}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2 . In contrast, Bernstein maintained that transfer would be expected from cycling to ice skating because of similarities in the required background corrections. Although skating and cycling are kinematically dissimilar, the critical feature in both tasks is the need to maintain dynamic balance on a very narrow base of support. Because the forces acting on the body are quite similar, they could be accommodated by regulating similar patterns of muscular forces}
{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2  }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2 and using similar background corrections}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2 . Bernstein\rquote s ideas offer an interesting way to think about transfer of learning, though it is important to point out that his insights on transfer have not been experimentally tested and so remain to be verified.\par }
{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-4 Task-specific coordination tendencies, such as those we discussed in chapter 5, can also be considered components that transfer from one task to another. For example, from a dynamical systems view of motor control, coordination tendencies and phase relationships that are common between tasks promote positive transfer (e.g., Kelso & Zanone, 2002; Wenderoth, Bock, & Krohn, 2002; Zanone & Kelso, 1997). Interestingly, newly learned patterns of coordination can disrupt patterns that were once stable (Zanone & Kelso, 1992). These findings, according to dynamical systems proponents, suggest that an abstract representation of the underlying coordination }
{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-3 dynamics is at the heart of transfer of learning. Further evidence to support this \u173 ?contention comes from the observation that learning a new phase relationship with one set of effectors, such as the arms, will transfer to another set of effectors, such as the legs (Camachon, Buekers, & Montagne, 2004; Kelso & Zanone, 2002).

{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2\u173 ?College, Columbia University, in the early part of the 1900s. To account for transfer effects, Thorndike (1914) proposed the }

{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2 \'d1or specific characteristics of the skill, such as components of the skill being performed. Additionally, Thorndike considered identical elements to include mental processes that shared the same brain cell activity as the physical action.\par }
{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1 According to a }{\*\cs53\fs20\b0\i\expnd0\expndtw-1 similarity of skill components}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1

{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-3 An example of the}{\*\cs53\fs20\b0\i\expnd-1\expndtw-3  spatial location change}{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-3
 \u173 ?occurs when you must drive a car different from your own. Although the brake pedal and accelerator on every car is in the same general location, subtle differences in position have been considered responsible for an effect labeled }
{\*\cs53\fs20\b0\i\expnd-1\expndtw-3 unintended acceleration}{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-3  (Schmidt, 1993). Unintended acceleration occurs when drivers mistakenly apply pressure to the accelerator rather than the brake pedal. The results can be tragic because the driver often panics and presses the accelerator harder and harder in an attempt to stop the car. Another example of a spatial location change for a new experience occurs when people must drive a car on the opposite side of the\'caroad to the one they are accustomed to. This situation represents the rearrangement of several spatial locations as now the stick shift, rear-view mirror, and indicator are positioned on opposite sides of the body. Although these objects are familiar, the need is to produce movements that are different from those used previously. The old, familiar movements now interfere with the movements that need to be made. Many drivers have cursed themselves after repeatedly engaging the windshield wipers during attempts to indicate a left- or right-hand turn! These examples demonstrate that when we learn a specific spatially oriented movement to accomplish an action goal, we require attention and time to learn a similar movement that is in a new direction or end location because of the negative transfer effect of the previous learning experience.\par }
{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2 The second situation that leads to negative transfer effects involves a }{\*\cs53\fs20\b0\i\expnd0\expndtw-2
change in the timing structure}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2  of a sequence of movements from a previously learned sequence. Two different types of timing }
{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-4 structure conditions are involved here. One is the }{\*\cs53\fs20\b0\i\expnd-1\expndtw-4 rhythmic pattern, or relative time structure,}
{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-4  learned for a sequence of movements. When people learn a specific relative time structure for a sequence of movements, such as when they learn a piece of \u173 ?
music, a dance sequence, and the like, and then are asked to perform the sequence and ignore the rhythmic structure they learned, they typically produce the learned rhythmic structure for a number of trials (e.g., Summers, 1975). Freestyle swimmers often encounter this problem when learning the six-beat kick (six kicks for every two arm strokes). Many swimmers naturally employ a two-beat or four-beat kick when learning to swim freestyle. In these swimmers, the lower frequency kick can persist for some time, making the learning of the six-beat kick quite challenging.\par }
{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-3 The second timing structure condition involves learning the types of phase relationships between limbs that we described earlier in the discussion of coordination dynamics. An example of this situation can be seen in the results of the experiment by Lee, Swinnen, and Verschueren (1995) that was described in chapter 11. Participants were asked to produce a difficult bimanual coordination pattern}
{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-3  that}{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-3  varied markedly from their natural coordination tendency, which was to move the arms in temporal synchrony. Recall that after achieving a small amount of progress in performing the new pattern by the end of the first day of practice (refer to figure 11.4), the participants reverted back to producing their natural symmetrical bimanual pattern. Thus the intrinsic coordination tendency to move the arms in temporal and spatial symmetry interfered with the participants\rquote  learning of a new asymmetrical movement pattern for the arms.}
{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-3 \par }{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-4 We often see either of the conditions that induce negative transfer effects when a person tries to \ldblquote un-learn\rdblquote  a way of performing a skill and learn a new way to perform it. This type of situation occurs in many skill learning contexts. For example, athletes who go from high school to college commonly have to learn to perform a skill in a way that is different from how they performed it in high school. Even though the way they performed it in high school was successful, the college coach knows that to achieve success at the college level, the athlete needs to learn to perform the skill differently. }
{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-4 Similarly, i}{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-4 n the rehab clinic, physical and occupational therapists often interact with patients who have learned to perform a skill in a certain way because of a disability. }
{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-4 For example, a stroke survivor who is several months post-stroke often has acquired a walking gait pattern that distributes force asymmetrically, with more force directed to the unaffected leg, which leads to less time spent on the affected leg in the stance phase of walking. }
{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-4 However, the therapist knows that continued performance in this manner will lead to additional physical problems, which means the patient must acquire a different manner of }
{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-4 walking than he or she has been using for several months.}{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-4  In these types of situations, people typically show a decrement in performance when they begin practicing the skill in a new way.

{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2 There are at least three likely reasons why negative transfer occurs. The first relates to the }{\*\cs53\fs20\b0\i\expnd0\expndtw-2
memory representation}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2  developed as a result of learning a skill. As a result of performing a skill in one specific way, such as shifting the gear shift in a car with the right hand, a specific perception-action coupling has developed between the perceptual characteristics of the task environment and the motor system. This coupling becomes a part of the memory representation for the action. When a person sees familiar perceptual characteristics in a performance environment, the motor system organizes itself in a preferred way to respond to those characteristics. Although this perception-action coupling allows for fast and accurate performing, it can become problematic when the familiar perceptual situation requires a movement that is different from what was learned. As you have seen in several discussions in this book, to change from the preferred state (i.e., the learned movement for the perceptual event) to a new state is difficult and takes practice.}

{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-4 was provided by Zanone and Kelso (1992) for a situation in which people learned}{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-4
 a novel phase relationship between the two index fingers. This concept is important because it suggests that any new learning will influence a whole range of behaviors connected to the new task. The systemwide changes that occur when infants learn to walk are an excellent illustration of this point. For example, Corbetta and Bojczyk (2002) have shown that infants regress from one-handed to two-handed reaching during the transition to independent walking}
{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-4 .}{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-4  Chen, Metcalfe, Jeka, and Clark (2007) }{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-4 showed }{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-4

Consider how successful students often navigate their way through high school and university as an example. The successful student doesn\rquote t typically succeed by transferring specific knowledge gained in one class to subsequent classes, though that does happen if the curriculum is designed appropriately. Rather, the successful student learns meta-strategies to cope with new material. Such strategies include how to approach new subjects, how to take effective notes, how to study, how to prepare assignments, and how to take exams. If learning is conceived as a form of problem solving, as Bernstein (1967, 1996) maintained, then much can be learned about the nature of problem solving by engaging in the problem-solving process, regardless of the nature of the problems that need to be solved.\par }

{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-4 Harry Harlow (1949) was the first to introduce the idea of learning how to learn, which he labeled }{\*\cs53\fs20\b0\i\expnd-1\expndtw-5
learning sets}{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-4 , in a very well-cited review of how animals learn to discriminate object properties. Harlow argued that animals with higher-order intelligence learned to solve new problems quickly by learning patterns within similar classes of previously experienced problems. Karen Adolph (2005) used the learning to \line learn principle to describe how infants learn to balance as they acquire each new postural milestone. A major problem for the infant learning to balance in a posture like sitting is that the skill must be accomplished on a variety of different surfaces, while concurrently performing various secondary tasks, and against the backdrop of a rapidly changing body. All of the various parameters that can potentially influence sitting represent the problem space, or the class of problems, associated with acquiring skill at controlling that particular posture. Learning to adapt balance to changing constraints is slow and arduous but becomes easier as the infant gains more experience within the problem space. Adolph attributes the lack of transfer from one postural milestone to a new postural milestone (we referred to the lack of transfer from crawling to walking at the beginning of the chapter) to the different sets of problems each posture poses (e.g., Adolph, 1997, 2000). In other words, the learning set that characterizes sitting is very different from the one that characterizes standing.\par }
{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-4 At the other end of the lifespan, Seidler (2007) has shown that learning how to learn is preserved in older adults. Participants moved a joystick to hit targets on a computer screen with concurrent feedback about the joystick position. One group practiced the original task and learned to adapt to three different rotations of the feedback display about the start location (15, 30, and 45 deg) on their first day of practice. On the second day, they practiced the original task without rotation of the display and adapted to two new task variations}
{\*\cs53\fs20\b0\i\expnd-1\expndtw-4 \'d1}{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-4 a change in the size of the displayed movements on the screen, and a repeating sequence of movements (up, down, left, right). Two other groups practiced the original aiming task for the same number of trials that the first group practiced all of the rotation variations. On the second day, the other groups either adapted to the changed size of the displayed movement or the repeating sequence of movements. The primary finding was faster adaptation to the new task variations on day 2 by the group that had practiced multiple task variations on day 1. Thus, multiple learning experiences facilitated transfer to the new tasks on day 2 even though the tasks were quite different from the original ones that were practiced. }
{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-4 Other researchers have reported that prior participation in a wide range of physical activities or in organized athletics facilitates the learning of new skills (e.g., Boisgontier, Serbruyns, & Swinnen, 2017; Wayne & Miller, 2018).}
{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-4 \par }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2 Interestingly, although learning how to learn has been described as an example of transfer of learning, Seidler (2010) notes that the brain areas that contribute to learning to learn are likely more similar to those associated with early learning than traditional transfer of learning. The early phase of learning sensorimotor adaptation tasks involves the basal ganglia thalamocortical loops, the medial cerebellum, the anterior cingulate cortex, the inferior frontal gyrus, and visual and parietal cortical areas. She hypothesizes that learning to learn involves enhanced contributions from these regions. In contrast, later learning involves the lateral cerebellum, parietal, and cingulated motor areas. She notes that transfer of learning is typically associated with reduced contributions of the early learning network, and overlapping activation with late learning regions.\par }

{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2 Given such a foundation of evidence, very few experiments published since those by Cook have focused only on whether bilateral transfer occurs (e.g., Latash, 1999; Nagel & Rice, 2001; Rice, 1998; Weeks, Wallace, & Anderson, 2003).

{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2 Reasons for investigating this question are theoretical as well as practical. From a theoretical per\u173 ?
spec\u173 ?tive, knowing whether bilateral transfer is symmetric or asymmetric would provide insight, for example, into the role of the two cerebral hemispheres in controlling movement. That is, do the two hemispheres play similar or different roles in movement control?\par }
{\fs20 A more practical reason for investigating this question is that its answer can help professionals design practice to facilitate optimal skill perfor\u173 ?
mance with either limb. If asymmetric transfer predominated, the therapist, instructor, or coach would decide to have a person always train with one limb before training with the other; however, if symmetric transfer predominated, it would not make any difference which limb the person trained with first.\par }
{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2 The generally accepted conclusion about the \u173 ?direction of bilateral transfer is that it is }{\*\cs53\fs20\b0\i\expnd0\expndtw-2
asymmetric.}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2  But there is some controversy about whether this asymmetry favors transfer from preferred to nonpreferred limb, or vice versa. The traditional view has been that there is a greater amount of transfer when a person practices initially with the preferred limb.\par }
{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1 Although some controversy continues about this question (see St}{\*\cs56\f8\fs20\b0\i0\expnd0\expndtw-1 \'9a}
{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1 ckel & Weigelt, 2012, for an analysis of how some of this controversy might be resolved), there is sufficient evidence to recommend that for most skill training and rehabilitation situations, the greater amount of transfer occurs }

{\*\cs53\fs20\b0\i\expnd0\expndtw-1 .}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1  This approach not only is consistent with the bulk of the research literature concerned with bilateral transfer, but also is supported by other factors that need to be taken into account, such as motivation.

{\fs20 The }{\*\cs53\fs20\b0\i dynamical systems theory}{\fs20  of motor control also provides a basis for bilateral transfer as noted in the previous discussions of intrinsic dynamics. This theory of motor control also states that what is learned is not specific to the limb used to practice the skill. The dynamical systems theory refers to skill learning as \ldblquote effector independent,}
{\fs20 \rdblquote  which means that when a motor skill is learned, coordination dynamics are learned without reference to the limb, or limbs, involved in practicing the skill. Rather, what is acquired is an abstract representation of the coordination dynamics. For example, as noted earlier, Kelso and Zanone (2002) showed that participants in an ex\u173 ?
periment who learned a novel relative phase with their arms or legs transferred }{\fs20 those same}{\fs20  relative phase characteristics to the nonpracticed pair of limbs. Similar results were reported by Camachon, Buekers, and Montagne (2004) for the transfer between walking and arm movements. }
{\fs20 It is important to note }{\fs20 that }{\fs20 although }{\fs20 these experiments do not involve bilateral trans\u173 ?fer as we have considered it, they demonstrate the effector independence of skill learning and }
{\fs20 how well}{\fs20  people can transfer what is learned to a different set of effectors, which supports the motor control explanation for bilateral transfer.}
{\fs20 \par Evidence of brain interhemispheric transfer of }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2 the motor components of tasks has also been used }
{\fs20 to support the motor control explanation for bilateral transfer (}{\fs20 Lee, Hinder, Gandevia, & Carroll, }{\fs20 \line }
{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw2 2010}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw2 ). One way researchers have demonstrated this mediation is by measuring the EMG activity in all four limbs when one limb performs a movement. When EMG activity occurs, it tells }
{\fs20 researchers that the central nervous system has forwarded commands to those muscles. In fact, research conducted as long ago as 1942 showed that the greatest amount of EMG activity occurs for the contralateral limbs (i.e., the two arms), a lesser amount occurs for the ipsilateral limbs (i.e., arm \line and leg on the same side), and the least amount occurs for the diagonal limbs (Davis, 1942).\par }
{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw2 Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has also established a neural basis for bilateral transfer. For example, a series of experiments involving the learning of a 12 item finger sequence with the right hand found that the supplemental motor area (SMA) of the cortex had more activity when the skill was performed well with the left hand than when it was performed poorly (Perez et al., 2007). In fact, in one of these experiments when SMA activation was blocked by the use }
{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw2 \line }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw2 of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), no bilateral transfer occurred. Halsband and Lange (2006) have provided a particularly interesting discussion of the neural basis for bilateral transfer, with an emphasis on the asymmetries in brain activity that are associated with left-to-right and right-to-left transfer.\par }

There is likewise no doubt that bilateral transfer involves a motor control basis as well. This is \u173 ?
consistent with our discussion in chapter 5 of the control of coordinated action. It is also consistent with research evidence that there is some motor out\u173 ?

{\fs18\expnd0\expndtw-1 Mark Latash (1999) reported a study in which students in his undergraduate class at Penn State University were required to learn a new skill as part of their class experience. The new skill was mirror writing, which involved handwriting a sentence on a piece of paper while looking in a mirror so that it would read correctly in the mirror, not on the paper. Note that this rearrangement of the familiar relation between a motor output and its perceptual consequences is exactly where we\rquote d expect to see negative transfer. During a pretest the students wrote the sentence, \ldblquote I can write while looking in the mirror,\rdblquote  five times with one hand and then the other hand. For each trial, they timed how long it took to write the sentence and counted the \u173 ?
errors they made. The students then practiced writing the sentence fifteen times a day, five days a week, for three weeks using the dominant hand only. At the end of the practice period, they did a posttest that required them to perform the task as in the pretest. By comparing the writing performance of the nondominant hand during the pre- and posttests, the students could determine if bilateral transfer resulted from the 225 practice trials with the dominant hand. The results showed that on the posttest for the nondominant hand, they wrote the sentence 40 percent faster than on the pretest, and their errors decreased by 43 percent.\par }

{\*\cs55\fs18\b\i0\expnd0\expndtw-1 }{\fs18 You may be surprised to learn that acquiring a new motor skill influences the development of nonmotor skills in addition to other motor skills. Joseph Campos and his colleagues have provided some of the best illustrations of this principle through their documentation of the profound psychological changes that occur after infants learn to crawl (see Campos et al., 2000, for a review). The onset of crawling heralds a psychological revolution, characterized by broad-scale changes in perception, perceptual motor coordination, spatial cognition, memory, and social and emotional functioning.\par }
