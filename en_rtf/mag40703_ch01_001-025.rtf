{\fs18 These simple observations highlight how dependent we are on our capacity to learn and perform motor skills. Skill, when viewed broadly as a capacity to control our bodies and the world around us, is a biological necessity. The degree of skill we possess is expressed through our use }
{\fs18 of}{\fs18  }{\fs18 movements to deal with the myriad problems we encounter on a daily basis. Without some degree of skill to escape from predators, to find food, to find or build shelter, and to procreate, animals would quickly perish. Humans are unrivaled in their capacity for acquiring skill, as witnessed by the incredible feats of the professional athlete, dancer, and musician, but also the young child who can ride a bicycle or the patient relearning to walk after an accident. We are capable of a degree of resourcefulness and adaptability that far exceeds the capabilities of other animals. These traits have }
{\fs18 enabled humans}{\fs18  to profoundly change the environment in which we live. \par This book examines our fascinating capacity to control and acquire motor skills. The book focuses on \line helping you understand how people perform and }
{\fs18\expnd-1\expndtw-4 learn, and how you can help people perform and learn, \line }{\fs18 motor skills. It highlights a wide range of factors that are known to influence how motor skills are performed, how quickly they are learned, how well they are learned, and how well they are retained over long periods of time. In addition to the traditional factors that have been emphasized in the field, such as the way in which instruction and augmented feedback are provided, and the amount and type of practice given to the learner, the book also covers a range of other variables that have become prominent in the last few years, including the learner\rquote s motivation and self-\u173 ?
confidence, as well as his or her control over what happens during practice.\par As you engage in this study, you will find it useful to draw general conclusions to apply what you learn to a broad range of motor skills, rather than making many specific statements about many skills. The starting point for doing this is the classification of motor skills into broad categories that emphasize the similarities rather than the differences among skills.\par }

{\fs18 For example, the skill of maneuvering a wheelchair through a crowded hallway and that of hitting a pitched baseball seem quite distinct. However, both skills have one characteristic in common that influences how they are learned and performed. People must perform both skills in an \ldblquote open\rdblquote  environ\u173 ?\u173 ?
ment. This means that to perform the skill successfully, a person must adapt certain aspects of his or her movements to changing characteristics in the performance environment. For the wheelchair skill, this means that the person must be able to maneuver successfully through a crowded hallway in which people are walking in various directions and speeds. For hitting a baseball, the changing environment involves the ball itself as it moves toward the person. For both of these skills, performance success requires the performer to adapt quickly and accurately to changing conditions. When we view them in terms of this common characteristic, we can see that these two seemingly diverse skills are related.\par }

{\fs18 The study of }{\*\cs64\fs18\b\i0\expnd0\expndtw-1 motor learning}{\fs18  emphasizes the acquisition of motor skills, the performance enhancement of learned or highly experienced motor skills, or the reacquisition of skills that are difficult to perform or cannot be performed because of injury, disease, and the like.

Researchers may observe people performing motor skills in laboratory, clinical, or natural settings. To answer the research questions described in the preceding paragraphs, researchers could engage in either the behavioral or neurophysiological level of study. As you will read in chapter 2, researchers, as well as practitioners, use a variety of performance measures to quantitatively or qualitatively evaluate a person\rquote s performance of a skill. Researchers who study motor learning, control, and development will often use their observations of behavior (i.e., motor skill performance) to infer neu-rophysiological mechanisms that are responsible for the behavior. For investigations at a neurophysiolog-ical level of study, researchers directly or indirectly observe central and peripheral nervous system components as they interact with muscles involved in performing a motor skill.}

{\fs18 To establish a foundation on which to build your study of motor learning and control, it is essential to have a good understanding of motor skills, which are the focus of both areas of study and are an important component of the three general influences on motor skill performance depicted in figure 1.1. To help you develop your understanding of motor skills, the remainder of this chapter will address two important points. First, we will consider what distinguishes motor skills from other skills and define some other commonly used terms related to the term }

 and }{\*\cs62\fs20\b0\i\expnd0\expndtw2 neuromotor processes}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw2  from each other, it is important to differentiate the two ways in which the term }
{\*\cs64\fs20\b\i0\expnd0\expndtw2 skill}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw2  is used. First, }{\*\cs62\fs20\b0\i\expnd0\expndtw2 skill}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw2
 is a commonly used word that in this text denotes an activity or }{\*\cs62\fs20\b0\i\expnd0\expndtw2 task that has a specific purpose or goal to achieve.}
{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw2  We will elaborate on this usage of the term in the next section of the chapter. Second, the term }{\*\cs62\fs20\b0\i\expnd0\expndtw2
skill}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw2  is used to denote some degree of competence or capacity to perform a task. For example, we might refer to someone as a skilled }
{\*\cs62\fs20\b0\i\expnd0\expndtw2 golfer}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw2 , or a }{\*\cs62\fs20\b0\i\expnd0\expndtw2 skilled}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw2
 neurosurgeon, or a }{\*\cs62\fs20\b0\i\expnd0\expndtw2 skilled}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw2  pianist. When the term is used in this way, we place a value judgment on the quality of someone\rquote s performance. We classify their performance somewhere along a continuum that varies from unskilled to highly skilled.\par }

{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-3 Although the second usage of the term }{\*\cs62\fs20\b0\i\expnd-1\expndtw-3 skill}{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-3
 has been defined in many different ways, three criteria are typically analyzed to determine }{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-3 a person}
{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-3 \rquote }{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-3 s skill level, which refers to}{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-3  where along the skill continuum a person\rquote s performance would be classified. The first criterion is the extent to which the person can consistently achieve the goal of the task, with highly skilled individuals showing a greater capacity to consistently achieve the goal of the task than less-skilled participants. The second criterion is the extent to which the person can achieve the task under a range of different conditions. Highly skilled individuals can achieve success under a much wider range of conditions and circumstances than their less-skilled counterparts. For example, the skilled quarterback }
{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-3 in American football}{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-3  can complete passes to many different receivers running many different routes at many different speeds. He can complete the passes on different fields, in different weather conditions, when fatigued or injured, and when faced with many different types of pressure from his opponents or from the consequences associated with not performing up to expectation. The highly skilled individual typically has a much richer repertoire of movements to draw upon when faced with the myriad of situations he or she is likely to encounter.\par }
{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2 The final criterion used to assess individuals\rquote  level of skill is their }{\*\cs62\fs20\b0\i\expnd0\expndtw-2
degree of efficiency}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2 . Skilled individuals are much more efficient than less-skilled individuals. Their efficiency can be seen in the strategies they use to solve problems, in the way they pick up and process information and deploy their attention, and in the amount of muscular effort they use to accomplish a task. Skilled individuals often make difficult tasks look effortless and they can appear to have all the time in the world, even in tasks that impose severe time limitations on the performer.\par }
{\fs20 As students of motor learning and control, understanding the characteristics of skill and how we become skillful is a central concern. One might say that it is }
{\*\cs62\fs20\b0\i the}{\fs20  central concern. Throughout the book you will see many references to the characteristics of skill and we will pay particular attention to the process of becoming skillful in chapter 12 and to the variety of ways in which skill acquisition can be facilitated in chapters 13 to 19.\par }

{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1 Characteristics of skills and actions.\u8194\'20Several }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw0 characteristics are common to motor skills. First, there is }

{\*\cs62\fs20\b0\i\expnd0\expndtw0 performed voluntarily;}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw0  in other words, we are not considering reflexes as skills.

{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-3 One additional characteristic identifies the types of motor skills of interest in this text: They }{\*\cs62\fs20\b0\i\expnd-1\expndtw-3
need to be learned, or relearned,}{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-3  in order for a person to achieve the goal of the skill. In our example, piano playing clearly must be learned.

{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1 In the motor learning and control research litera-ture, the term }{\*\cs64\fs20\b\i0\expnd0\expndtw-1 movements}
{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1  indicates }{\*\cs62\fs20\b0\i\expnd0\expndtw-1 specific \u173 ?patterns of motion among joints and body segments.}
{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1  This means that movements are the component parts of motor skills. In other words, movements are the means by which action goals are accomplished or problems are solved. For example, locomotion is an action that has the goal of transporting the body from one location to another. The action goal could be accomplished using many different movement patterns, including walking, running, hopping, skipping, galloping, and so on. Each movement pattern is defined by a particular pattern of relative motions among joints and body segments, though each would be an effective way of solving the problem of transporting the body from one location to another. In addition, assuming a person chooses walking as the means to locomote from one place to another, a variety of head, body, and limb motions can occur that enable a person to walk successfully. For example, our arms and legs move in different and distinct ways when we walk on a concrete sidewalk and when we walk on an icy sidewalk\'d1or on a sandy beach. However, although certain motions may differ, the motor skill we perform in each of these different situations is walking.\par }

{\fs20 The important point here is that a variety of movements can accomplish the same action goal. This highlights the }{\*\cs62\fs20\b0\i
many-to-one}{\fs20  relationship between movements and actions. For example, if a person\rquote s goal when walking up a set of stairs is to get to the top of the stairs, he or she can achieve this goal by using a variety of different movements. A person can take one step at a time very slowly, or take each step very quickly, or take two steps at a time, and so on. In each situation, the action goal is the same but the movements the person uses to achieve the goal are different. Similarly, if a person\rquote s action goal is to throw a ball so that it hits a target\'d1which might be a person who would catch it\'d1the goal can be achieved with several different movement characteristics. For example, the person could throw the ball overhand, sidearm, or underhand. All would achieve the action goal but would use very different movement characteristics.\par }

{\fs20 The relationship between movements and actions \line is also }{\f5\fs20\b0\i one-to-many,}{\fs20  meaning that one movement pattern could be used to achieve many different action goals. For example, walking or swimming could be used to move the body from one location to another, but they could also be used to maintain the body in one location if walking on a treadmill or swimming against a current. So, when the context changes, the same movement can be used to accomplish completely different purposes. Movie aficionados may remember the classic scene from the movie }
{\f5\fs20\b0\i The Karate Kid}{\fs20  in which Mr. Miyagi asks Daniel to wash and then polish his car using wax-on-wax-off movements with his hands. This is another example of the one-to-many relationship between movements and actions. In one context, the wax-on-wax-off movements could be used to polish a car}
{\fs20 ,}{\fs20  and in another context}{\fs20 ,}{\fs20  they could be used to protect the person against an attacker. The take-home message here is that the purpose any movement fulfills is entirely determined by the context in which the movement occurs.\par }

{\fs20 Neuromotor processes represent the third level on which motor behavior is often analyzed. In contrast to actions and movements, which can be clearly seen by the naked eye, neuromotor processes are the mechanisms within the central and peripheral nervous system as well as the muscular system that underlie the control of movements and actions. These processes cannot be observed directly with the naked eye, though they can be measured quite precisely using a number of different techniques that are introduced in chapter 2. The relationship between neuromotor processes and movements is also many-to-one and one-to-many. For example, many combinations of muscle fibers could be used to lift the arm above the head. This capacity of the neuromuscular system enables the arm motion to be reproduced consistently even though some muscle fibers might not contribute to the movement because they become fatigued or injured. On the other hand, highlighting the one-to-many relationship between neuromotor processes and movements, a muscle might be activated in an identical way from one moment to the next but lead to a different movement if the context changes. The function of the pectoralis major muscle provides a good example here. When the arm is held out to the side below the horizontal, activation of the pectoralis major muscle brings the arm back to the side (it adducts the arm). However, when the arm is above the horizontal, the same activation of the pectoralis muscle will bring the arm closer to the head (it abducts it). The resulting movement is completely dependent on the initial position of the arm even though the muscle is activated in exactly the same way. Similarly, the same activation of the biceps brachii might flex the elbow in one situation but lead to no movement or elbow extension when a weight is held in the hand. Again, the resulting movement is dependent on the context in which the neuromotor processes are activated.\par }

{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2 There are three reasons why it is important and useful to distinguish these three levels of study. First, actions (skills), movements, and neuromotor processes represent the order in which motor control and learning are prioritized, thus highlighting what should be emphasized at different stages of learning. The learner\rquote s first priority is to understand the action goal and to explore strategies to achieve it. The second priority is to discover the best movement to accomplish the action goal given the unique characteristics of the learner and environmental context. The third priority is to refine the movement and make it more efficient by modifying neuromotor processes. Too often, practitioners ignore this hierarchy of priorities and introduce skills as movement patterns to be learned rather than as action goals to accomplish. Learners are less actively involved in the learning process when this happens and are less likely to develop the problem-solving skills needed to become independent learners.\par }

{\fs20 The second reason to distinguish the different levels of study is that not all people can accomplish the action goal using the same movement pattern or perform the same movement using the same neuromotor processes. Learners must discover a movement pattern that is effective and efficient given their unique characteristics, including body size, injuries, disabilities, abilities, fitness, prior learning, and psychological attributes among many others. The effective teacher or therapist acknowledges this diversity and helps the learner to discover the most suitable way to perform a skill. Even world-class athletes come up with unique ways to accomplish the skills within their sports. For example, Hall of Fame basketball player, Rick Barry, made 90% of his free throws during his 14-year professional career by tossing the ball \ldblquote granny style\rdblquote  with two hands. Similarly, Dick Fosbury revolutionized the sport of high jumping when he introduced his \ldblquote Fosbury Flop\rdblquote  at the 1968 Mexico City Olympics.\par The third reason to distinguish the different levels of study is that different measures are used to evaluate what\rquote s happening at each level of study. Given the order in which the different levels are prioritized during motor control and learning}
{\fs20 ,}{\fs20  this implies that different measures might be taken to assess learning at different stages of practice. In addition, researchers are often interested in asking questions about motor control and learning that require different levels of study. These questions can only be answered by selecting measures that are appropriate for that level of study. In chapter 2 you will see examples of the many different types of measures used to characterize actions, movements, and neuromotor processes.\par }

{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2 We can classify motor skills by determining which skill characteristics are similar to those of other skills. The most prevalent approach has been to categorize skills according to one common characteristic. This common characteristic is divided into two categories, which represent extreme ends of a continuum rather\u8239 ?
than dichotomous categories (as illustrated in figure\u8239 ?1.2). This continuum approach allows a skill to be classified in terms of which category the skill characteristic is more like, rather than requiring that the characteristic fit one category exclusively.\par }

{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2 We can see the benefit of using a continuum for this skill classification system when we consider }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2
motor skills that involve both large and small muscles as the primary muscles required to achieve the action goal.

{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw2 The use of the gross/fine distinction for motor skills is popular in a number of settings.

We also find this classification system in rehabilitation environments. Physical therapists typically work with patients who need to rehabilitate gross motor skills such as walking, whereas occupational therapists more commonly deal with patients who need to learn fine motor skills. People who are involved in early childhood development also find the gross/fine categorization useful and have developed tests of motor development along the gross/fine dimension. Also, industrial and military aptitude tests commonly use the gross and fine motor skill distinction.\par }

We can classify skills such as steering an automobile, tracking a moving cursor on a computer monitor with a joystick, swimming, and walking as continuous skills. Although some continuous skills, such as walking and swimming, may have distinct movement beginning locations, the end location is arbitrary, and the movements are repetitive.\par }
{\fs20 Sometimes a skill requires a series or sequence of discrete movements, such as shifting gears in a standard shift car, or playing a piece on a piano. We refer to these types of skills as }
{\*\cs64\fs20\b\i0\expnd0\expndtw-1 serial motor skills}{\*\cs64\f4\fs20\b0\i0\expnd0\expndtw-1 ,}{\fs20  although sometimes they are called }

As a result, it is best to locate serial motor skills on the continuum between the continuous and discrete skills categories. The gear shifting example is a good illustration. To shift gears in a car, the driver must perform a sequence of discrete movements. To shift from second to third gear, the driver performs a sequence of seven discrete movements. First he or she lifts a foot off the accelerator, then depresses the clutch with the other foot, then moves the gear shift forward to neutral, then to the right, then forward again to third gear, then releases the clutch, and finally depresses the accelerator.\par This classification system has been especially prevalent in the motor control research literature. Researchers have found, for example, that certain \line phenomena about how we control movement are \line applicable to discrete skills but not to contin\u173 ?
uous\u8239 ?skills and vice versa. The distinction between \u173 ?discrete and continuous skills is especially popular in the research literature of those who view motor skill performance from the perspectives of human engineering and human factors.\par }

{\fs20 One classification system has its roots in industrial as well as educational and rehabilitation settings. Researchers base this system on the stability of the\u8239 ?
environmental context in which the skill is performed (see Gentile, 2000). For this classification system, the term }{\*\cs64\fs20\b\i0\expnd0\expndtw0
environmental context}{\fs20  refers to the specific physical location where a skill is performed. It consists of }{\*\cs62\fs20\b0\i
three features:}{\fs20  }{\fs20 (1)}{\fs20  }{\fs20 the }{\*\cs62\fs20\b0\i supporting surface}{\fs20  on which the person performs the skill, }

other people or animals}{\fs20  involved in the performance situation. For example, if a person is hitting a ball, the relevant feature of the environmental context is the ball. For the skill of walking, the relevant environmental context features are the surface on which the person must walk, the presence or absence of an object, and/or other people or animals. And if other people are present, what is their activity? For example, walking while carrying luggage on a moving walkway on which some people are standing and others are walking is a much different, and more difficult, environmental context than is walking in a hallway with no other people.\par }

{\fs20 In this classification scheme, the term }{\*\cs62\fs20\b0\i stability}{\fs20  refers to whether the relevant environmental context features are }
{\*\cs62\fs20\b0\i stationary}{\fs20  (i.e., stable) or }{\*\cs62\fs20\b0\i in motion}{\fs20  (i.e., not stable). When the supporting surface, \u173 ?
object, or other people involved in the performance of a skill are stationary, the skill is a }{\*\cs64\fs20\b\i0\expnd0\expndtw-1
closed motor skill}{\*\cs64\f4\fs20\b0\i0\expnd0\expndtw-1 .}{\fs20  For these skills, }{\*\cs62\fs20\b0\i the relevant environmental context features are stationary, which means they do not change locations during the performance of a skill.}
{\fs20  For example, picking up a cup from a table while you are sitting on a chair is a closed motor skill; the chair (i.e., supporting surface) and the cup (i.e., object) do not move between the time you decide to pick up the cup and the moment you pick it up. Walking in a room full of furniture is also a closed motor skill, because nothing in the environmental context moves or changes location while you are walking. Other examples of closed motor skills are shooting an arrow at a stationary target, buttoning a shirt, climbing a flight of stairs, and \u173 ?
hitting a ball off a tee.\par }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2 An important feature of closed motor skills is that the performer initiates the movements involved in performing the skill when he or she is ready to do so. Because of this timing of movement initiation characteristic, some motor learning and control researchers refer to these types of skills as }
{\*\cs62\fs20\b0\i\expnd0\expndtw-2 self-paced.}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2 \par }{\fs20 Conversely, an }{\*\cs64\fs20\b\i0\expnd0\expndtw-1
open motor skill}{\fs20  is }{\f5\fs20\b0\i a }{\*\cs62\fs20\b0\i skill that a person performs in an environment in which supporting surfaces, objects, and/or other people or animals are in motion while the person performs the skill.}
{\fs20  To perform this type of skill successfully, the performer must act according to the movement of a supporting surface, object, and/or other people or animals. \u173 ?
Because performers of open skills must time the initiation of their movement}{\fs20 s}{\fs20  with an external feature in the environment, some motor learning and control researchers refer to these types of skills as }
{\*\cs62\fs20\b0\i externally paced.}{\fs20  \par Some examples of open motor skills that involve the performer\rquote s supporting surface in motion include surfing a wave and stepping onto \line a moving escalator; skills that involve objects in motion include striking a moving ball and catching a thrown ball; and skills that involve other \u173 ?
people or animals in motion include walking on a sidewalk crowded with people walking, running a distance race with other \u173 ?
runners, coordinating movements with a dance partner, and playing with a puppy.\par }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw2 Notice that we have classified the skill of \u173 ?
walking as }{\*\cs62\fs20\b0\i\expnd0\expndtw2 both an open and a closed skill.}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw2  This example illustrates that to classify a skill as open or closed, it is necessary to determine whether the supporting surface, objects, or other people in the environment are stationary or in motion. This means that when walking occurs in a hallway with no objects or other people, walking is a closed skill. Walking is also a closed skill if objects and/or \line other people are in the hallway, but stationary. However, if the objects and/or other people are in motion, walking becomes an open skill. Similarly, walking is an open skill when a person walks on a treadmill, which means the supporting surface is in\u8239 ?
motion. We can make the same distinction for several other motor skills. For example, hitting a ball from a tee is a closed skill, whereas hitting a pitched ball is an open skill. And, throwing a ball is a closed skill when throwing to a stationary person, but an open skill when throwing to a person who is moving.\par Consider how closed and open skills differ in terms of the performance demands placed on the person. A person can initiate his or her movements at will when performing a closed skill. In addition, the person does not need to adjust the movements to changing conditions while the performance is in progress. For example, to climb a set of stairs, a person can initiate his or her first step at will. However, quite the opposite is the case when someone performs open skills. To perform an open skill successfully, a person must time the initiation of movement to conform to the movement of the supporting surface, other people or animals, and/or objects involved in the action. If, for example, the person must step onto a moving escalator, the timing of when the first step can be initiated must conform to the speed and \u173 ?
position of the escalator. And for many open skills, changes can occur while an action is in progress that will require the person to make movement \u173 ?
adjustments to conform to these environmental changes. For example, the spin of a tennis ball will influence the direction and height of its bounce, which may require the tennis player to adjust his or her planned movements to return a serve after the ball hits the ground.\par }
{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw1 The open/closed classification system has achieved a large degree of popularity in instructional methodology contexts and increasing popularity in rehabilitation contexts. A likely reason for this is that the closed and open skill categories \u173 ?
relate so generally and easily to the types of motor skills involved in these settings. Skills in each of these categories follow common principles of instruction that instructors and therapists can readily apply to specific situations. The closed and open distinction between motor skills also has become increasingly common in the motor learning research literature, undoubtedly because of its simplicity and its ability to accommodate both complex \ldblquote real-world\rdblquote  skills and laboratory skills. A final reason for the classification system\rquote s popularity is that knowing whether a skill is open or closed provides immediate insights into the demands the skill places on attention, information processing, and movement planning. As discussed earlier, open skills place more demands on the performer because of the need to continuously monitor the environment and make ongoing adjustments to the movement. These insights can be very helpful when designing instruction, organizing practice, and providing feedback.\par }

Recall from our earlier discussion about open and closed motor skills that the environmental context features include the \u173 ?
supporting surface on which the person performs the skill and any objects or other people that may be involved. It is important to note that regulatory conditions do not refer to characteristics of a person\rquote s movements but only to characteristics in the environmental context in which a skill is performed.\par }

{\fs20\expnd1\expndtw3 Consider, for example, the regulatory conditions involved in walking from one location to another. The surface on which the person walks is a regulatory condition that determines the movement characteristics the person must use to achieve the action goal on that surface. The surface may be soft or hard, rough or smooth, flat or inclined, among other possible characteristics. To walk on a sandy beach, you would very likely move your body, legs, and feet differently from the way you would walk on a concrete sidewalk. Similarly, you would use different movements as you walked on a flat surface compared to a steep incline. In all these cases, you would need to modify how much force you applied to the surface, for how long, and in what direction. Objects and other \u173 ?
people may also be regulatory conditions in the walking environmental context. For example, how would your walking movements differ if a child\rquote s tricycle were in the pathway from a situation in which no object was there? And how would your walking movements compare when another person walked beside you, behind you, or in front of you?\par }
{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw2 We can see additional examples of regulatory conditions in the environmental context when a person must manipulate an object. If a person\rquote s action goal is to throw a ball to another person, or to catch a ball thrown by another person, important regulatory conditions relate to certain characteristics of the ball, such as size, shape, and weight. The size and shape might regulate where on the object you applied force whereas the weight would regulate how much force you needed to apply. For example, throwing a baseball and throwing a basketball would require distinctly different arm, hand, and finger movements to achieve the throwing action goal and different amounts of force. Similarly, a person could catch a tennis ball with one hand, but may need to use two hands to catch a beach ball.\par }
{\fs20\expnd1\expndtw4 In Gentile\rquote s taxonomy, an important distinction for differentiating motor skills is whether the reg\u173 ?
ulatory conditions are }{\*\cs62\fs20\b0\i\expnd1\expndtw4 stationary }{\fs20\expnd1\expndtw4 or}{\*\cs62\fs20\b0\i\expnd1\expndtw4
 in motion.}{\fs20\expnd1\expndtw4  Sometimes the regulatory conditions are stationary; this is the case when you walk on a sidewalk or hit a ball off a tee. Sometimes the regulatory conditions are in motion; this occurs when you must step onto an escalator or hit a pitched ball or try to catch a chicken. It is important to note that in this part of Gentile\rquote s taxonomy, you can see the application of the closed and open motor skills categories. Skills for which the regulatory conditions are stationary are closed skills, whereas those for which they are in motion are open skills. However, Gentile maintained that this closed/open distinction is too limiting to capture the wide range of skills that people perform every day. Because of this limitation, she added another environmental context characteristic.\par }

The addition of the two intertrial variability categories provides a more realistic way of understanding closed and open skills. For example, shooting free throws in basketball and hitting golf balls during a round of golf are both closed skills. But shooting free throws in a game involves no intertrial variability because the regulatory conditions remain the same for each shot, even though the situations in which they are performed may differ. In contrast, hitting golf balls during a round of golf involves regulatory conditions that differ for each shot.\line Thus, the performance demands of the round of golf require greater amounts of shot-to-shot preparation than shooting a free throw because the golfer cannot plan to repeat the same movements from one shot to the next. Similarly, the regulatory conditions for open skills may remain the same from one performance of the skill to the next. An example is hitting a series of tennis balls projected at the same speed by a ball machine. In contrast, during a tennis match, regulatory conditions change for every shot.\par }

All of these features can influence performance, but they do not determine movement characteristics in the same way as regulatory conditions. For example, the color of a ball (a nonregulatory condition) might influence how well it can be visually tracked and therefore how likely it is to be caught;  however, the size and speed of the ball (regulatory conditions) will precisely regulate the spatial and temporal characteristics of the catching movement. Regardless of what body parts are used to catch the ball, the spatial and temporal characteristics of the catching movement must conform to the spatial and temporal characteristics of the ball.\par }

{\fs20\expnd1\expndtw4 Gentile proposed that the taxonomy has practical \line value for practitioners. First, as noted earlier in the chapter, classifying skills provides insights into the demands that those skills place on the performer. Classification is actually an early step in task analysis\'d1a systematic analysis of the important characteristics of the performance environment and the skill that is used to understand the capabilities a person needs to succeed at the task (Arend & Higgins, 1976; Higgins, 1991). Once the practitioner understands the demands associated with a particular skill, the taxonomy can then be used to }
{\*\cs62\fs20\b0\i\expnd1\expndtw4 evaluate a learner\rquote s movement capabilities and limitations.}{\fs20\expnd1\expndtw4  The practitioner can determine deficiencies by systematically altering environmental contexts and/or action functions to identify skill perfor\u173 ?
mance characteristics that pose difficulty for an \u173 ?individual. The Closer Look box on the previous page provides an example of how a physical therapist could use the taxonomy to evaluate a patient\rquote s capabilities and limitations and how a physical education teacher could use it to evaluate a student\rquote s catching skills.\par }

{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw2 Second,}{\fs18\expnd0\expndtw2  }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw2 after the practitioner assesses performance problems, the taxonomy becomes a valuable tool for systematically }
{\*\cs62\fs20\b0\i\expnd0\expndtw2 selecting a progression of functionally appropriate activities}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw2  to help the person overcome his or her deficits and increase his or her skill performance capabilities. This is an important feature of the taxonomy, because it emphasizes the complementary part of the rehabilitation or skill training process. To assess skill deficits is important, but the effectiveness of any rehabilitation or training protocol depends on the implementation of appropriate activities to achieve functional goals for the patient or student. In the activity selection process, the therapist or teacher begins selecting activities related to the taxonomy category in which the person is not capable at first of handling the demands of the skill. Then, the professional can develop a program of rehabilitation or instruction by \u173 ?
systematically increasing the complexity of the skills included in the program.\par A third practical use of the taxonomy is as a means of }
{\*\cs62\fs20\b0\i\expnd0\expndtw2 charting the individual progress}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw2  of patients or students as they work to attain their rehabilitation or physical activity performance goals. Gentile emphasized the benefit of using the taxonomy to create a \ldblquote profile of competencies\rdblquote  that can aid the therapist or teacher in the assessment of the effectiveness of the rehabilitation or instructional program he or she developed for the patient or \u173 ?
student. Because the taxonomy follows a simple-to-complex progression of skills, it provides an \u173 ?objective basis for determining progress in overcoming skill performance deficits and increasing skill performance capabilities. When used in this way, the taxonomy provides an effective way for the therapist or teacher to establish a record that can satisfy demands for accountability of his or her time and effectiveness.\par }

{\fs18 For both the physical therapy and physical education examples, the performance evaluation steps provide a basis for determining a person\rquote s capabilities and limitations by systematically increasing the degree of complexity of the skill. For example, if the physical therapy patient can perform steps one and two but not three, the therapist knows that the patient is capable of static balance without and with holding an object but has limitations when performing body transport skills. Similarly, if the physical education student can perform steps one and two but not three, the teacher knows the student is capable of catching a ball while standing but has limitations when trying to catch a ball while running. Based on these evaluations, the therapist or teacher can then develop a systematic plan of activities to help the patient or student increase his or her capabilities in the performance of these skills.
