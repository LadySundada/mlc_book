{\fs18\expnd-1\expndtw-4 An important decision you must make when you teach any motor skill concerns whether it is better to have the learner practice the skill in its entirety or by parts. Consider the following sport skill instruction situation as an example. Suppose you are teaching a beginning tennis class. You are preparing to teach the serve. Most tennis instruction books break down the serve into six or seven parts: the grip, stance, backswing, ball toss, forward swing, ball contact, and \u173 ?
follow-through. You must decide whether to have the students practice all of these parts together as a whole or to have them practice each component or group of components separately.\par }

{\fs18\expnd-1\expndtw-4 The question of whether to use whole or part practice also confronts professionals in a rehabilitation \u173 ?
setting. For example, when a patient needs to learn the task of getting out of bed and getting into a wheelchair, this decision comes into play. Although this task has \u173 ?
distinct and identifiable parts, the therapist must determine whether to have the patient practice each part separately or always practice the whole sequence.}
{\fs18\expnd-1\expndtw-4 \par }{\fs18\expnd0\expndtw-2 There are other situations in which the whole\'d0part practice decision must be made.

{\fs18 The issue of whether to use whole or part practice has been a topic of discussion in the motor learn\u173 ?ing\u8239 ?literature since the early 1900s. Unfortunately, that early research often led to more confusion than \u173 ?
understanding. One of the reasons was that researchers tended to investigate the issue in terms of whether one or the other type of practice is better \u173 ?
for\u8239 ?learning specific skills, without concern for determining skill-related characteristics that could help them make useful generalizations about which practice scheme would be preferable for certain skills. \u173 ?
For\u8239 ?example, the question of whole versus part practice was investigated for learning a maze task (\u173 ?Barton,\u8239 ?
1921) or a piano score (Brown, 1928) as well as for learning how to juggle (Knapp & Dixon, 1952) and master gym\u173 ?nastic skills (Wickstrom, 1958), to name a few examples. Although this research provided useful information about teaching these specific skills, it did little to establish a guiding principle for decisions about whether to use whole or part practice.}

{\fs20 A breakthrough in a guiding principle for the use of whole versus part practice occurred in the early 1960s, when James Naylor and George Briggs (1963) hypothesized that the }
{\*\cs53\fs20\b0\i organization and complexity characteristics of a skill could provide the basis for a decision to use either whole or part practice.}

{\fs20 Naylor and Briggs defined }{\f5\fs20\b\i0 complexity}{\fs20  in a way that is consistent with the term\rquote s use in this text. They stated that }
{\*\cs53\fs20\b0\i\expnd0\expndtw0 complexity}{\fs20  refers to the number of parts or components in a skill, as well as the attention \u173 ?
demands of the task. This means that }{\*\cs53\fs20\b0\i a highly complex skill would have many components and de\u173 ?mand\u8239 ?
much attention,}{\fs20  especially from a beginner. Performing a dance routine, serving a tennis ball, and getting out of bed and into a wheelchair are examples of highly complex skills. Low-complexity }
{\fs20 \line }{\fs20 skills have few component parts and demand relatively limited attention. For example, the skills \u173 ?of shooting an arrow and picking up a cup are low in complexity. }
{\*\cs53\fs20\b0\i\expnd0\expndtw0 It is important to keep the term complexity distinct from difficulty.}{\fs20  As you saw in the discussion of Fitts\rquote  law in chapter 7, skills of the same complexity can vary in their level of difficulty.}
{\fs20 \par }{\fs20\expnd1\expndtw3 The }{\f5\fs20\b\i0\expnd1\expndtw3 organization}{\fs20\expnd1\expndtw3  of a skill refers to the relationships among the component parts of a skill. A skill has a }
{\*\cs53\fs20\b0\i\expnd1\expndtw3 high level of organization}{\fs20\expnd1\expndtw3  when its component parts are spatially and temporally interdependent. This means that the successive parts of a highly \u173 ?
organized skill are like a chain of events in which the spatial-temporal performance characteristics of any one part are dependent on the spatial-temporal performance characteristics of the part performed just before it. Because of this characteristic, it would be difficult to perform only one part of a highly organized skill. The jump shot in basketball is a good example of a highly organized skill, because how a person performs each part will depend on the manner in \line which he or she performed the part(s) that preceded it. Although the arm and hand movements involved in the release of the ball could be practiced separately, the spatial \u173 ?
location of the arm and hands as well as the timing of the ball release must be related to other parts of the skill, such as the direction and the height of the jump. In contrast, a skill has a }
{\*\cs53\fs20\b0\i\expnd1\expndtw3 low level of organization}{\fs20\expnd1\expndtw3  when the spatial-temporal relationships among the component parts of a skill are relatively independent.

{\fs20\expnd1\expndtw3 Based on the Naylor and Briggs hypothesis, assessing the levels of complexity and organization of a skill helps the practitioner decide whether to use whole or part practice. If the skill is }

{\*\cs53\fs20\b0\i\expnd1\expndtw3 high in complexity and low in organization}{\fs20\expnd1\expndtw3  most efficiently by the part method. For example, the skills of executing a tumbling routine in gymnastics; reaching for, grasping, and drinking from a cup; and }

{\fs20 To determine which complexity and organization combinations describe a particular skill, it is necessary to first analyze the skill. This analysis needs to focus on identifying the skill\rquote s component parts and the extent to which the spatial-temporal performance characteristics of those parts are interdependent.

{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw2 By far, most of the motor skills we perform as a part of our daily living activities and sports would be characterized as more complex than simple.

extremes of low and high }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw2 on the organization continuum}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw2 , an additional task analysis step is required.

{\fs20\expnd1\expndtw3 Many of the motor skills discussed throughout this text require people to simultaneously move their arms or legs to achieve a specific spatial and/or temporal goal. Recall from the discussion of coordination in chapter 5 that the coordination tendency is for the arms or legs to move spatially and temporally together. What this means in terms of part versus whole practice is that because of this coordination tendency, a skill that requires symmetric spatial-temporal coordination of the arms (e.g., the butterfly and breaststroke in swimming) or legs (e.g., the flutter kick for a crawl stroke in swimming or the leg movements for cross-country skiing) would be high in organization. As a result, a whole-practice approach would be preferable. However, when the task requires the two arms or legs simultaneously to do }

{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw1 Because asymmetric coordination of the arms is more characteristic of motor skills than asymmetric coordination of the legs, we will address skills in this section that we referred to in chapter 7 \line as \u173 ?
asymmetric bimanual coordination skills. \u173 ?Consider, for example, the simultaneous arm movements involved in the playing of many musical instruments, such \u173 ?

Other instruments, such as the piano and drums, may require this type of movement characteristic but also include simultaneous asymmetric movement of the legs. Sport skills such as the sidestroke in swimming and the tennis serve also involve this type of bimanual coordination. Is a part-practice strategy the best approach for learning these types of skills, or would a whole-practice \u173 ?
approach be preferable? Some controversy exists among researchers, and there is evidence to support either approach (see Walter & Swinnen, 1994). If a part-practice approach is used, the most appropriate strategy is }
{\*\cs53\fs20\b0\i\expnd0\expndtw1 fractionization.}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw1 \par }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1 For asymmetric bimanual skills, the fractionization strategy involves practicing each arm or hand individually before performing the skill bi-manually.

{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1 An interesting exception to strict use of prac\u173 ?ticing each limb separately before performing the \u173 ?
skill}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\u8239 ?bimanually was an experiment by Kurtz and Lee (2003) in which participants learned an asym}
{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-3 metric bimanual polyrhythm task. The task simulates}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1  a \u173 ?situation that occurs in the playing of musical instruments when one hand plays one rhythmic \line pattern while the other plays a different pattern, which is not uncommon for playing the \u173 ?
piano or drums. Participants practiced a 2:3 polyrhythm for time \u173 ?cycles of\u8239 ?1.8 sec (i.e., 1,800 msec). To perform the polyrhythm correctly, the left hand taps two beats of equal time intervals (i.e., one every 900 msec) while the right hand tapped three beats of equal intervals (i.e., one every 600 msec). This means that the right hand made one tap 600 msec after the beginning of a cycle, then the left hand made one tap 300 msec later (i.e., 900 msec from the beginning), 300 msec later the right hand made its second tap, and 600\u8239 ?
msec later, both hands made their final tap simultaneously. \par }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw0 Practice involved tap\u173 ?ping according to a metronome sound. A part-practice group practiced each hand separately; a whole-practice group practiced both hands together every trial, and a part\'d0whole practice group practiced each hand separately while listening to a metronome beat for both hands. Thus, unlike any of the experiments discussed \u173 ?
earlier, in which participants practiced \u173 ?an\u8239 ?\u173 ?asymmetric \u173 ?bimanual skill, the Kurtz and Lee experiment included a practice condition that involved unimanual part practice but with participants listening to the same rhythmic pattern which the whole-practice group practiced. Results, which can be seen in figure 18.1, showed that whole and part\'d0whole practice conditions led to the best transfer performance of the bimanual polyrhythm, which was without a metronome. Although these results differ from those of the typical fractionization type of practice, the discrete polyrhythmic characteristic of the skill may account for the difference. However, it is important to note that consistent with the fractionization practice strategy, the part\'d0whole practice strategy used in the Kurtz and Lee experiment involved unimanual practice. The unique characteristic was that their unimanual practice included simultaneously hearing the rhythmic pattern of the bimanual task.}

{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2 A common example of the progressive part method is a frequently used practice scheme for learning the breaststroke in swimming. The breast-stroke is easily subdivided into two relatively independent parts, the leg kick and the arm action. Because a difficult aspect of learning the breast-stroke is the timing of the coordination of these \u173 ?
two\u8239 ?parts, it is helpful for the learner to reduce the attention demands of the whole skill by practicing each part independently first. This enables the student to direct most of his or her attention to only the limb \u173 ?

{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2 \par }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1 Skills that involve learning movement sequences}{\fs20  lend themselves particularly well to the progressive part method. Researchers have demonstrated this for both laboratory and real-world skills. For example, Watters (1992) reported that the progressive part method was beneficial for learning to type an eight-key sequence on a computer keyboard. And Ash and Holding (1990) found that people learn\u173 ?

{\fs20  In this experiment, participants learned a musical score of twenty-four quarter notes, grouped into three sets of eight notes each. The first two sets were easy and the third set was difficult. Two types of the progressive part method were better than the whole method for learning to perform this musical score, for which performance was based \u173 ?
on\u8239 ?errors made, rhythmic accuracy, and rhythmic consistency. Of the two progressive part methods, the one that prescribed an easy-to-difficult progression tended to be better than the one stipulating a \u173 ?

takes advantage of the benefits of both part and whole methods of practice.}{\fs20\expnd1\expndtw3  The part method offers the advantage of reducing the attention demands of performing the whole skill, so that the person can focus attention on specific aspects of a part of the skill. The whole method, on the other hand, has the advantage of practicing together the important spatial and temporal coordination of the parts. The progressive part method combines both of these qualities. Thus, the attention demands of performing the skill are under control, while the parts are put together progressively so that the learner can practice important spatial and temporal coordination requirements of performing the parts \line as a whole.\par }

operating the actual device or by providing a practice situation in which certain attention demands are reduced.

{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2 Sometimes it is not advisable or practical to separate the parts of a skill physically for practice. This, however, does not mean that a learner cannot practice parts of the whole skill. It is possible to practice the whole skill, but focus attention on specific parts that need work.

momentary intentions.}{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-6  When applied to a performance situation, this factor comes into play when a person focuses his or her attention on a specific aspect of the performance. Because we can manipulate our attention resources in this way, we can direct attention to a specific part of a skill while performing the whole skill.\par }
{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-3 An example of research evidence supporting the use of this attention-directing strategy for part practice is an experiment by Gopher, Weil, and Siegel (1989). Participants learned a complex com\u173 ?
puter game, known as the Space Fortress Game, that requires a person to master perceptual, cognitive, and motor skills as well as to acquire specific knowledge of the rules and game strategy. The player must shoot missiles at and destroy a space fortress. He or she fires the missiles from a movable spaceship, controlling spaceship movement and firing \u173 ?
using a joystick and a trigger. To destroy the fortress, the player must overcome several obstacles, such as\u8239 ?the fortress\rquote s rotating to face the spaceship to \u173 ?
defend itself, protection of the fortress by mines that appear on the screen periodically and can \u173 ?destroy the spaceship if it runs into them, and so on (see Man}

emphasized a strategy requiring them to direct attention to one specific component of the skill. One group\rquote s instructions emphasized focusing attention on controlling the spaceship. The second group\rquote s instructions emphasized focusing attention on handling the mines around the fortress. The third group received spaceship control instructions for the first three practice sessions and then mine-\u173 ?
handling \u173 ?instructions for the next three sessions. When the researchers compared the performance of these three groups against that of a control group that had not received any strategic instructions, the effectiveness of the attention-directing instructions was evident. As you can see in figure 18.3, the control group improved with practice, but not as much as the three instruction groups did.

{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1 These results provide evidence that attention-\u173 ?directing instructions can serve to establish a part-practice environment while allowing the person to practice the whole skill.

{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1 An important connection needs to be made between the use of attention-directing instructions as a part-practice strategy and our discussions in chapters 9 and 14 about the focus of attention.

{\fs18\expnd1\expndtw3 In an experiment that has become a classic, Knapp and Dixon (1952) told university students who had no previous juggling experience to practice until they could make 100 consecutive catches while juggling three paddle-tennis balls. Results showed that students who followed a whole-practice approach achieved this goal in sixty-five trials, whereas those who followed a part-practice regime needed seventy-seven trials. Because juggling is relatively high in complexity, an important caveat is that whole practice might not be the most effective practice strategy for learners whose information processing capacity is limited. In support of this idea, Chan, Luo, Yan, Cai, and Peng (2015) showed that children\rquote s age determined whether whole or part practice was most effective for learning a juggling task. Fifth graders learned best with whole practice, whereas first and third graders learned best with part practice.\par }

{\fs18 Training wheels have been used for many years to simplify the task of learning to ride a bicycle. Although training wheels seem to be an excellent example of the }
{\*\cs53\fs18\b0\i simplification}{\fs18  approach to organizing part practice, one can also see elements of the }{\*\cs53\fs18\b0\i
fractionization}{\fs18  and }{\*\cs53\fs18\b0\i segmentation}{\fs18  approaches in their use because the wheels enable the learner to practice the pedaling, steering, and braking components of the bicycling skill independent of the balance component. As proficiency increases on the other components, the balance component is gradually introduced and made more challenging by adjusting the height of the training wheels above the ground so that the bike can tilt more and more from side to side. \par }
\pard\plain \s45\f6\fs18\ltrpar\qj\fi240\li0\ri0\sb0\sa0\tx240\facenter\sl220\slmult0\expnd0\expndtw0\cf1\up0\charscalex100\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\accnone\hyphpar1\lang1033
{\fs18 In recent years, the balance bicycle has become an increasingly popular way to introduce a child to bicycling. The balance bike is simply a bicycle without pedals or brakes. When the bicycle saddle is adjusted so that the child\rquote s feet can touch the ground, he or she can then propel the bike by essentially \ldblquote walking\rdblquote  with it between the legs and can coast by lifting the feet off the ground. Interestingly, the first bicycle ever invented, by the German Karl von Krais in 1817, was referred to as a \ldblquote swiftwalker\rdblquote  because it also had no pedals and so was propelled in the same way. In contrast to training wheels, the balance bicycle allows the learner to first practice the balance and steering components of bicycling independently of the pedaling and braking components. \par }
{\fs18\expnd-1\expndtw-5 Balance bicycle advocates argue that it is better to master the balance and steering components before \u173 ?
adding the pedaling and braking components. More\u173 ?over, they argue that balancing and steering need to be \u173 ?practiced together because countersteering, which prevents the bicycle from tilting to the side, is integral to learning to balance on the bicycle. }
{\fs18\expnd-1\expndtw-5 In other words, balancing and steering are interdependent (highly organized) components in bicycling.}{\fs18\expnd-1\expndtw-5
 Some critics of training wheels have suggested that the wheels prevent the learning of countersteering, particularly if the height of the wheels is adjusted incorrectly, so that when the child rides without training wheels he or she has to unlearn and relearn how to steer. Whether this is true or not needs to be verified independently and whether training wheels or balance bicycles represent the best way to initially teach a child how to ride a bike is an open question at this point in time. Nevertheless, both methods are interesting examples of how part practice is commonly used to teach new skills.\par \par }
