{\fs18 There seem to be at least two reasons for the increased interest in demonstration and skill learning. One reason is the phenomenal growth of interest in the role of vision in skill learning. Because demonstrating how to do a skill typically involves visual observation on the part of the learner, researchers have been able to use the study of demonstration and skill learning to assess how the visual system is involved in skill acquisition and performance. Another reason for the current interest is that we know so little about how to effectively implement this very common instructional strategy. As a result, researchers have been making an increased effort to improve our understanding of the role of demonstration in skill instruction and learning.}

Thus reviews of research related to the effectiveness of demonstrations as an instructional strategy concluded that the practitioner should use demonstration only after determining that the instructional situation indeed warrants the use of demonstration, rather than some other form of providing information about skill performance. In the following sections, we consider some of the concerns that practitioners need to take into account before making this instructional decision.\par }

It is also important to keep in mind that what we perceive may be at a conscious or nonconscious level of awareness. For example, when people are asked later to describe verbally what they saw in a demonstration that helped them perform a skill, they do not always give a very accurate accounting.\par }

research indicate that the visual system automatically detects in a movement pattern invariant information for determining how to produce the observed action.

walking and }{\fs20\u173 ?}{\fs20 running, by observing the moving dot patterns. Later, Cutting and Kozlowski (1977) showed that from observing moving dot patterns, people actually could identify their friends.

First, people can recognize different gait patterns accurately and quickly without seeing the entire body or all the limbs move. Second, the most critical information people perceive in order to distinguish one type of gait pattern from another is not any one characteristic of the gait, such as velocity of the limbs. Instead, people use the invariant relative time relationship between two components of gait. The question that naturally arises, then, is if people use relative motion information to recognize movement patterns, is the provision of this source of information in a demonstration the most effective way to bring about changes in coordination? \par }

{\fs20 \line }{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-4 by Schoenfelder-Zohdi (1992), in which subjects practiced the slalom ski simulator task shown in fig}
{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-4\u173 ?}{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-4 ure 14.2, supports this expectation. This simulator consisted of two rigid, convex, parallel tracks on which a movable platform stood. A participant stood on the platform with both feet and was required to move the platform to the right and then to the left as far as possible (55 cm to either side) with rhythmic slalom ski\'d0like movements. The platform was connected on either side to each end of the apparatus by strong, springlike rubber bands, which ensured that the platform always returned to the center (normal) position. Thus, the participant had to learn to control the platform movement by using smooth ski-like movements, just as he or she would if actually skiing. Participants practiced this skill for several days after they had either observed a skilled model perform the task or received verbal information about the goal of the task. A kinematic analysis of limb movements showed that participants who had observed the skilled demonstration developed coordinated movement patterns earlier in practice than did those who had not observed the demonstration. Figure 14.3}
{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-4  shows one example of these results. }{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-4 Moreover}{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-4 , in a meta-analysis }
{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-4 \line }{\fs20 of 64 studies involving a variety of motor skills, }{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-4 Ashford, Davids, and Bennett (2006) showed that demonstrations convey relative motions required to approximate modeled movement behaviors. }
{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-4 Research has also shown}{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-4  that the observation of full-body demonstrations are not necessary to bring about changes in movement coordination. For example, Horn, Scott, Williams, and Hodges (2005) showed equivalent changes in the pattern of relative motions underlying a soccer chipping skill when learners watched a video display or a point-light display of a skilled performer.\par }
\pard\plain \s17\f4\fs20\ltrpar\qj\fi240\li0\ri0\sb0\sa0\tx240\facenter\sl240\slmult0\expnd0\expndtw0\cf1\up0\charscalex100\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\accnone\hyphpar1\lang1033
{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-3 Although changes in coordination have been documented following the observation of full-body video demonstrations and point-light displays, learners do not necessarily need to see a model\rquote s relative motions to reproduce them. Support for this notion has been provided in an experiment by Hodges, Hayes, Breslin, and Williams (2005) in which participants learned a novel kicking motion that was used by a well-practiced player to \ldblquote scoop\rdblquote  a soccer ball over a barrier and onto a target. The participants were shown a point-light display of either the knee, ankle, and toe during the kicking task (Leg), just the ankle and foot (Foot), or only the toe (Toe). Results indicated that the group receiving only the information about the toe more closely matched the pattern of hip-knee coordination used by the model than the groups receiving the additional information. The superiority of the Toe group was seen when the learners practiced the kicking motion after the demonstration, when they practiced again after receiving a full-body point-light display of the kicking motion, and when they actually kicked the ball over the barrier toward the target. Interestingly, larger changes in knee-ankle coordination in the Leg and Foot groups were seen when the learners had to kick the ball than when they were shown the full-body demonstration. In\'caother words, the constraint imposed by the ball had a greater influence on the acquisition of the coordination pattern than did viewing the pattern of relative motions of the well-practiced player\rquote s whole body.\par }
{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-3 The findings reported by Hodges et al. (2005) are consistent with Latash }{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-3 and }
{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-3 Turvey\rquote s (}{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-3 1996}{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-3 ) claim that people are generally concerned about controlling the distal point of the limb during the execution of everyday movements. Hodges, Williams, Hayes,}
{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-3  }{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-3 and Breslin (2007) have provided additional examples of coordination changes induced by observing the motions of end effectors and, consistent with the }

{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-3  hypotheses introduced in }{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-3 c}{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-3 hapter 9, have also suggested that demonstrating movement effects (e.g., the trajectory of a ball) might be as effective in inducing coordination changes as providing end-point information in a demonstration. Hodges et al. (2007) also note, however, that modeling end-point information is not always more effective than modeling relative motion information in facilitating the acquisition of new patterns of coordination. Rather, the effects seem to be task specific and potentially also specific to the learner\rquote s skill level. Clearly, more research is needed to resolve exactly what sources of \u173 ?
invariant information should be provided to learners and when they should be provided during the learning process. In the meantime, practitioners should be aware that it is important to consider potential differences in how movement is perceived (recognized) versus how it is controlled, particularly during the early stages of skill acquisition, when determining the most appropriate information to provide to learners in a demonstration.\par }

In addition to using fMRI, researchers have also used EEG recordings to provide evidence of the involvement of a mirror neuron system during action observation (e.g., Calmels, Hars, Holmes, Jarry, & Stam, 2008}
{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-3 ; Denis, Rowe, Williams, & Milne, 2017}{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-3 ). \par }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1 Taken together, these brain activity recording methods indicate the existence of a mirror neuron system, although many questions remain unresolved concerning its specific characteristics and functions.

{\*\cs59\fs20\b0\i\expnd-1\expndtw-4 simulation theory}{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-4  proposed that the same brain regions were recruited during action observation, motor imagery, and movement execution. These regions were thought to include the prefrontal, premotor, primary motor, and parietal cortices, and the basal ganglia and cerebellum. Recruitment of these areas during action observation was presumed to be the basis for improvements in motor learning that follow from watching others perform motor skills. More recent analyses have shown that despite similarities in the brain regions recruited during action observation and movement execution, distinct differences also exist. For example, in a meta analysis that included 595 action observation experiments and 142 movement execution experiments, Hardwick, Caspers, Eickhoff, and Swinnen (2018) showed that observing and executing simple movements of the arms, legs, and face consistently recruited similar premotor and parietal cortical networks. However, less than half of the premotor-parietal network for movement execution was also involved in action observation. Moreover, action observation did not recruit sub-cortical structures, like the basal ganglia, or the cerebellum, which consistently participate in movement execution. These findings suggest that previous researchers have overestimated the similarities in the brain networks involved in observing and executing movements, and they raise interesting questions about the neural contributions that action observation makes to motor learning.\par }

{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1 One way to effectively implement this use of demonstration is by pairing students, athletes, or patients in situations where one of the pair performs the skill while the other observes. After a certain number of trials or amount of time, the pair switches roles. On the basis of what we know from the research literature, learning of the skill can be facilitated for both the performer and the observer by having the teacher, coach, therapist, or some other knowledgeable person provide verbal feedback to the performer. Another effective strategy is to provide the observer of the pair with a checklist of key aspects of the skill. The observer should look for each aspect, check it on the list, and then provide some feedback to the performer.

For the beginner, demonstration provides an effective means of communicating the general movement pattern of the action or skill. As we discussed in chapter 12, Gentile considered this to be the goal of the first stage of learning. When applied to the use of demonstration, Gentile\rquote s view suggests two things. The first is that it is beneficial to demonstrate a skill }

{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2 Earlier, we pointed out that a skilled demonstration communicates the invariant characteristics of a movement pattern, which suggests that more than one observation is essential. If this is the case, then we would expect that the more frequently a beginner observes a skilled demonstration, the more opportunity the beginner will have to acquire the movement pattern. At least }

{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2 . Another}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2 , by Hand and Sidaway (1993), involves the learning of a golf skill. }
{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2 A third experiment by Hebert (2018) involves the learning of a cup stacking task. All three}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2
 experiments provided evidence that more frequent observations of the model yielded better skill learning. }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2
The Hebert (2018) experiment revealed particularly interesting findings because learners practiced the task in groups of three, such that the first learner }
{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw2 received no demonstration, the second learner }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2 observed the first learner complete all practice trials, and the third learner observed the first and second }
{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2 \line }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2 learners complete all practice trials. The second learner performed the task significantly faster than the first learner and the third learner performed significantly faster than the first and second learners during the acquisition phase of the experiment.}
{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2 \par }{\fs20 An experiment by Weeks and Anderson (2000), which investigated the issue of the timing of demonstrations, provides some additional insight into both the timing and frequency questions. The demonstrated skill involved a skilled volleyball player \u173 ?
hitting an overhand serve. Participants, who had no}{\fs20  }{\fs20 previous experience hitting this serve, observed a video of ten demonstrations and performed thirty serves. The all-prepractice group watched all ten before performing the thirty serves; the interspersed group observed one demonstration and then performed three serves, in series throughout the practice period, and the combination group viewed five demonstrations before performing fifteen serves, then viewed five demonstrations before performing the final fifteen serves. All participants performed in two retention tests, which were 5 min and 48 hr}
{\fs20 ,}{\fs20  respectively}{\fs20 ,}{\fs20  after the practice session. The results (figure 14.4) showed the benefit of the combination and all-prepractice conditions, as both led to better form and accuracy scores than the interspersed condition. In terms of the timing and frequency of demonstrations, these results indicate that several demonstrations should precede practice. Although it would be interesting to see how these demonstration schedules would have influenced learning had they been implemented in several days of practice, the results for one practice session reveal the importance of prepractice demonstrations.\par A twist on the way in which demonstrations are scheduled has been to allow learners to self-select when they receive demonstrations. We will see in }
{\fs20 c}{\fs20 hapter 15 that this technique originated in the context of providing augmented feedback. Interestingly, when learners are given this opportunity they tend to request demonstrations very infrequently, often preceding less than }
{\fs20 10 percent}{\fs20  of the trials on which they could potentially request them. Ong and Hodges (2012) provided a summary of }

{\fs20 The second experiment by Bie}{\f9\fs20\b0\i0\u324 ?}{\fs20 kiewicz et al. (2019) focused on learning the rhythm of the golf putting stroke.

The participants in the auditory and visual template groups showed larger improvements in putting performance than participants in the control group that received no template, though the differences were subtle. In addition, participants who practiced with the auditory template tended to retain their improvements better than those who practiced with the visual template.}
{\fs20  The }{\fs20 third}{\fs20  example is an experiment by Lai, Shea, Bruechert, and Little (2002) in which they found that auditory modeling enhanced the learning of a sequence of five time intervals when two keyboard keys were alternately depressed.

{\fs20 \u8194\'20}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw0 The predominant view is based on the work of Bandura (1986) concerning modeling and social learning. This view, called the }
{\*\cs58\fs20\b\i0\expnd0\expndtw0 cognitive mediation theory,}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw0  proposes that when a person observes a model, he or she translates the observed movement information into a symbolic memory code that forms the basis of a stored representation in memory. The reason the person transforms movement information into a cognitive memory representation is so that the brain can then rehearse and organize the information. The memory representation then serves as a guide for performing the skill and as a standard for error detection and correction. To perform the skill, the person first must access the memory representation and then must translate it back into the appropriate motor control code to produce the body and limb movements. Thus, cognitive processing serves as a mediator between the perception of the movement information and the performance of the skill by establishing a cognitive memory representation between the perception and the action.\par }

{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw2 According to Bandura, four subprocesses govern observational learning. The first is the }{\*\cs59\fs20\b0\i\expnd0\expndtw2
attention process,}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw2  which involves what the person observes and the information he or she extracts from the model\rquote s actions. Because of the importance of the attention process for learning, directing full attention to the demonstration rather than the mere \u173 ?
observation of it is important for optimal learning. The second is the }{\*\cs59\fs20\b0\i\expnd0\expndtw2 retention process,}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw2
 in which the person transforms and restructures what he or she observes into symbolic codes that the person stores in memory. Certain cognitive activities, such as \u173 ?
rehearsal, labeling, and organization, are involved in the retention process and benefit the development of this representation. The }
{\*\cs59\fs20\b0\i\expnd0\expndtw2 behavior reproduction process}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw2  is the third subprocess; during it, the person translates the memory representation of the modeled action and turns it into physical action. Successful accomplishment of this process \u173 ?
requires that the individual possess the physical \u173 ?capability to perform the modeled action. Finally, the }{\*\cs59\fs20\b0\i\expnd0\expndtw2
motivation process}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw2  involves the incentive or motivation to \u173 ?perform the modeled action. This process, then, focuses on all those factors that \u173 ?
influence a person\rquote s motivation to perform. Unless this process is completed, the person will not \u173 ?perform the action.\par }
{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1 Several research studies have provided support for the cognitive mediation theory by demonstrating evidence that is in line with predictions of the theory. For example, Ste-Marie (2000) provided support for the prediction that }
{\*\cs59\fs20\b0\i\expnd0\expndtw-1 attention}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1  is an \u173 ?important process in observational learning. In a series of four experiments, participants who had to divide their attention between performing a cognitive secondary task (counting backward by threes) and observing a model did not learn the skill as well as those who did not perform a secondary task. In an experiment discussed in chapter 10, Smyth and Pendleton (1990) showed that the prevention of the }
{\*\cs59\fs20\b0\i\expnd0\expndtw-1 rehearsal}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1  process hindered learning a skill. In their experiment, some participants \u173 ?
engaged in movement activity during the interval of time between the demonstration of a sequence of movements and their attempts to reproduce those movements. These participants recalled fewer movements than those who did not engage in activity during this time interval. Finally, Blandin and Proteau (2000) provided evidence that observational learning involves the development of effective }
{\*\cs59\fs20\b0\i\expnd0\expndtw-1 error detection and correction,}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1  which the cognitive mediation theory describes as an important function of the memory representation that \u173 ?
develops during observational learning. In two \u173 ?experiments, prior observation of a model permitted learners to }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\u173 ?}
{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1 estimate their errors as effectively as learners who had physically practiced the tasks.}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1

person does not need to transform the information received via the visual system into a cognitive code and store it in memory. This is the case because the visual information directly provides the basis for \u173 ?
coordination and control of the various body parts required to produce the action.

a form of learning that occurs without conscious awareness of what is being learned (see the next section for examples). For example, Masters and Poolton (2012) reviewed a body of research showing that implicitly learned tasks tend to be less susceptible to stress or pressure than explicitly learned tasks. The explanation for this finding is similar to the explanation that has been proposed to account for the benefits of an external focus of attention. Masters }

Rather than provide instructions about how to move the arm and paddle to accomplish the task, learners were simply told to swing the bat up the hypotenuse of an imagined right-angled triangle each time they hit the ball. The learners who were given this instruction were able to perform the shot more effectively than learners who were given explicit instructions about how to move the arm and paddle, when the groups were put under pressure or asked to concurrently perform a secondary task while making the shot.\par }

{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1 Sometimes we ask people to tell us what they were looking for or looking at when they performed a skill, so that we can help them correct their visual attention focus. However, research investigating the need for conscious awareness of environmental cues when learning skills reveals that people can learn to select relevant cues from the environment without being consciously aware of what those cues are.\par }
{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-3 A good example of research demonstrating this result is an experiment reported by Magill (1998). Participants watched a target cursor move in a complex waveform pattern across a computer screen for 60 sec. The participants\rquote  task involved pursuit tracking of the target cursor by moving a lever on a tabletop to make their own cursor stay as close as possible to the target cursor. The unique feature was that the target cursor moved randomly for the }
{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-3\u173 ?}{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-3 second and third 20 sec segments on every trial, but it made the same movements on every trial during the first }
{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-3 \line }{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-4 20 sec segment. The participants practiced this }{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-4
pursuit tracking}{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-4  task for approximately twenty-four trials on each of fifteen days. The results, shown in figure 14.6, indicated that as they practiced, they performed better on the first segment than on the other two segments. But what is more important is that when interviewed, none of the participants indicated that they knew that the target cursor made the same pattern during the first segment on every trial. Thus the participants attended to and used the regularity of the cursor movement during the first segment, even though they were not consciously aware of that characteristic. This lack of conscious awareness of the invariant movement pattern of the }
{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-4 target cursor indicates that the participants }{\*\cs59\fs20\b0\i\expnd-1\expndtw-4 implicitly}{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-4
 learned the regulatory environmental context features that directed their movements as they tracked the target cursor.\par }{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-4
Although the research just described indicates that people can learn to use relevant environmental context features without being instructed to look for them, there is a common assumption that we can facilitate skill learning by giving instructions that would make people aware of these features. For \u173 ?
example, a tennis teacher may tell a student that a certain racquet-head angle at ball contact during a serve indicates a specific type of serve, which the student should try to look for to predict that type of serve. However, what is not so commonly known is that this type of instruction could actually hinder rather than facilitate learning, especially when the specific features looked for occur infrequently in a series of trials.}
{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-4 \par }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1 Green and Flowers (1991) reported an experiment that serves as a good example of the research evidence demonstrating this negative effect. Participants played a computer game in which they manipulated a joystick to move a paddle horizontally across the bottom of the monitor to try to catch a \ldblquote ball,\rdblquote  which was a dot of light, that moved for }
{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1 \line }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1 2.5 sec from the top to the bottom of the screen. The ball moved according to one of eight pathways. On 75 percent of the trials, the ball made deviations from the normal pathway that predicted the specific final position of the ball. Thus, participants\rquote  detection of these pathway-deviations characteristics could help them increase their catching accuracy. One group of participants received explicit instructions about these characteristics and their probability of occurring; the other group did not. Participants practiced for five days for a total of 800 trials. The results showed that both groups improved. However, the explicit-instruction group made more errors than the group that had had no instruction. The \u173 ?
authors concluded that the instructed participants directed so much of their attentional resources to trying to remember the rule and looking for its \u173 ?
occurrence that their perfor\u173 ?mance was disrupted, because they did not have sufficient attention to \u173 ?devote to the catching task \u173 ?
itself.}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1 \par }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2 Research has also shown the negative influence of explicit information on the implicit learning of an open motor skill by stroke patients. In an experiment by Boyd and Winstein (2004), patients who had experienced a basal ganglia stroke practiced a pursuit tracking task similar to the one described earlier in the Magill (1998) study, except that a trial was only 30 sec. One group of patients was told about the repeating portion of the pathway. Rather than helping the patients to perform the task better than those who were not given this information, the awareness of this task characteristic led to poorer learning.\par }

{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-4 Another factor that we need to consider is that \u173 ?verbal instructions direct the person\rquote s attention to certain performance goals of the skill. A good example of this is the way verbal instructions can bias the strategy a person uses to learn speed-accuracy \line skills which we discussed in chapter 7. An experiment by Blais (1991) illustrates this type of \u173 ?
strategy bias. The task was a serial pursuit tracking task in which participants controlled a steering wheel to align a pointer as quickly and accurately as possible to target positions on a screen. Three groups of participants received verbal instructions that emphasized being accurate, being fast, or being both accurate and fast. The instruction emphasis was especially \u173 ?
evident during the first of the five days of practice. On this day, the \ldblquote speed instruction\rdblquote  group}{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-4

emphasize both speed and accuracy adopted a\u8239 ?strategy that led to fast movement times\'d1but at\u8239 ?the expense of performance accuracy. And although the \ldblquote accuracy instruction\rdblquote  group performed the most accurately, its participants did so in a manner that eventually gave them the fastest average overall \u173 ?
re\u173 ?sponse time, which included \u173 ?reaction time, movement time, and movement-\u173 ?correction time for errors. Thus, for this task, }
{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-4 where both speed and \u173 ?accuracy were equally \u173 ?impor\u173 ?tant for overall perfor\u173 ?mance, instructions that initially emphasize}

{\fs20 The results of the Blais (1991) experiment are consistent with predictions of both the motor \u173 ?program and dynamical systems theories we discussed in chapter 5. To apply the speed-accuracy skill to those theories, the movement accuracy component refers to the movement pattern used to perform the\u8239 ?
skill. In both theories the movement pattern consists of invariant characteristics that remain the same when the skill is performed at\u8239 ?
different \line speeds. For these motor control theories, movement speed can be readily changed \u173 ?according to the \u173 ?demands of the performance situation or intention of the performer. As a result, these theories predict that initial practice for a speed-accuracy skill should emphasize movement accuracy and a later emphasis on the speed component.\par }

Then, they said, \ldblquote turn,\rdblquote  to cue them to turn their \u173 ?
shoulders and hips to the ball. Finally, they said, \ldblquote hit,}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw0 \rdblquote  to \u173 ?direct their attention to tracking the ball to the point of contact on the racquet and to cue themselves to keep the head still and hit the ball solidly. After practicing this cueing strategy for five weeks, the players showed marked improvements in both performance and technique.\par }

{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-4 \u8194\'20}{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-4 The various uses of verbal cues just described indicate that verbal cues can be used for two different purposes. Sometimes the cue }
{\*\cs59\fs20\b0\i\expnd-1\expndtw-4 directs attention}{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-4  to a specific environmental event or to specific sources of regulatory information (in our example, \ldblquote ready,\rdblquote  \ldblquote ball,\rdblquote  and \ldblquote hit}
{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-4 \rdblquote  are such cues). In other cases, the cue }{\*\cs59\fs20\b0\i\expnd-1\expndtw-4 prompts action,}
{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-4  for either a specific movement (\ldblquote head down\rdblquote ) or a sequence of movements (\ldblquote turn\rdblquote ). The key to the effectiveness of verbal cues is that as the person practices and continues to use the cues, an association develops between the cue and the act it prompts. The benefit is that the person does not need to give attention to a large number of verbal instructions and can focus attention on the important perceptual and movement components of the skill.}
{\f4\fs20\b0\i0\expnd-1\expndtw-4  A question that remains to be addressed is whether these cues are most beneficial when they encourage an external focus of attention, regardless of whether they pertain to the environment or the movement (e.g., Wulf & Lewthwaite, 2016), or whether cues that encourage an internal or external focus of attention are equally effective.}

{\fs20 A benefit of observing a skilled demonstration is that the observer detects the invariant characteristics of the movement pattern involved in the performance of the skill.\par The point-light technique and research about what an observer perceives from a skilled demonstration shows that demonstration tends to be a more effective means of instruction when the skill being learned requires a new movement \u173 ?

{\fs18\expnd-1\expndtw-3 In a review of mirror neuron research, Pomeroy and colleagues in London, England (Pomeroy et al., 2005), concluded that the existence of a human mirror neuron system in the brain suggests the beneficial use of observation-based therapy for the rehabilitation of upper-arm movement in poststroke patients. The therapy would involve stroke patients observing a healthy person\rquote s arm movements during goal-directed activities. Since that proposal, researchers have reported experiments that have found support for the benefit of observational learning (referred to as \ldblquote action observation\rdblquote  by rehabilitation researchers) for improving arm and hand function of stroke patients, especially when combined with regular physical therapy (e.g., Celnik, Webster, Glasser, & Cohen, 2008; Small, Buccino, & Solodkin, 2012). Researchers have also shown that stroke patients can benefit from observing their own movements using a technique known as }
{\*\cs59\fs18\b0\i\expnd-1\expndtw-3 feedforward video self-modeling}{\fs18\expnd-1\expndtw-3 . For example, Steel et al. (2018) videotaped stroke patients performing a simple reaching and grasping task with their affected and un-affected arm. The videos were edited such that the patients could observe either their best movements with their affected arm or a video-reversed version of their movements with the un-affected arm that was designed to create the illusion the affected arm could perform the task proficiently. Significant improvements in performance on the task with the affected arm and in movement self-confidence were seen after the patients simply watched the videos three times per day over one week.}
