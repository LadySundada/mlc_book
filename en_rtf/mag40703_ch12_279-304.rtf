{\fs18\expnd0\expndtw-1 Have you ever noticed that people who are skilled at performing an activity often have difficulty teaching that activity to a beginner? This difficulty is due in part to the expert\rquote s failure to understand how the beginner approaches performing the skill each time he or she tries it. In other words, the expert has difficulty behaving or thinking like a beginner. To facilitate successful skill acquisition, the teacher, coach, or therapist must consider the point of view of the student or patient and ensure that instructions, feedback, and practice conditions are in harmony with the person\rquote s needs.\par }

{\fs18 Think for a moment about a skill you are proficient in. Remember how you approached performing that skill when you first tried it as a beginner. For example, suppose you were learning the tennis serve. Undoubtedly you thought about a number of things, such as how you held the racquet, how high you were tossing the ball, whether you were transferring your weight properly at contact, and so on. Now, recall what you thought about after you had considerable\line practice and had become reasonably proficient at serving. You probably did not continue to think about all the specific elements each time you served.\par }
{\fs18 In the rehabilitation clinic, imagine that you are a physical therapist working with a stroke patient and helping him or her regain locomotion function. Like the tennis pro, you are a skilled performer (here, of locomotion skills); the patient is like a beginner. Although there may be some differences between the sport and the rehab situations because the patient was skilled prior to the stroke, in both cases you must approach skill acquisition from the perspective of the beginner.}

{\fs18 An important characteristic of learning motor skills is that all people seem to go through distinct stages as\u8239 ?they acquire skills. Several models have been \u173 ?
proposed to identify and describe these stages. We discuss two of the more influential of these next and will elaborate on Bernstein\rquote s ideas about learning throughout the chapter. It is important to note that each of these models presents performer and performance characteristics associated with each stage of learning that we will refer to throughout the chapters that follow. An excellent way to synthesize the information that follows is to relate learning a new skill to solving a movement problem. This helpful analogy from Bernstein provides important insights into what changes are likely to occur as learners become more skillful and what practitioners can do to facilitate those changes.}

7, and Michael Posner presented the acknowledged classic learning stages model in 1967. Their model continues to be referred to in textbooks and by \u173 ?
researchers today. They proposed that learning a motor skill involves three stages. During the }{\*\cs52\fs20\b0\i\expnd0\expndtw-2
first stage,}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2  called the }{\f3\fs20\b\i0\expnd0\expndtw-2 cognitive stage}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2  of learning, the beginner}
{\*\cs53\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2\super 1}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2  focuses on cognitively oriented problems related to what to do and how to do it. For example, beginners typically try to answer questions such as these: What is my objective? How far should I move this arm? What is the best way to hold this implement? Where should this arm be when my right leg is here? Additionally, the learner must engage in cognitive activity as he or she listens to instructions and receives feedback from the instructor.\par }
\pard\plain \s12\f4\fs20\ltrpar\qj\fi240\li0\ri0\sb0\sa0\tx240\facenter\sl240\slmult0\expnd0\expndtw0\cf0\up0\charscalex100\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\accnone\hyphpar1\lang1033
{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2 Performance during this first stage is marked by numerous errors, and the errors tend to be large ones. Performance during this stage also is highly variable, showing a lack of consistency from one \u173 ?
attempt to the next. And although beginners may be aware that they are doing something wrong, they generally do not know what they need to do to improve.\par }
{\fs20 The }{\*\cs52\fs20\b0\i second stage}{\fs20  of learning in the Fitts and \u173 ?Posner model is called the }{\f3\fs20\b\i0
associative stage}{\fs20  of\u8239 ?learning. The transition into this stage occurs \u173 ?after an unspecified amount of practice and performance improvement. The cognitive activity that characterized the cognitive stage changes at this stage, }
{\fs20\charscalex90\u173 ?}{\fs20 because the person now attempts to }{\*\cs52\fs20\b0\i associate}{\fs20  specific environmental cues with the movements \u173 ?
required to achieve the goal of the skill. The person makes fewer and smaller errors since he or she has \u173 ?acquired the basic fundamentals or mechanics of the skill, although room for improvement is still available. Because improvements continue, Fitts and Posner referred to this stage as a }
{\*\cs52\fs20\b0\i refining}{\fs20  stage, in which the person focuses on performing the skill successfully and being more consistent from one attempt to the next. During this refining process, performance variability decreases, and people acquire the capability to detect and identify some of their own performance errors.\par }
{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-4 After much practice and experience, which can take many years, some people move into the final }{\f3\fs20\b\i0\expnd-1\expndtw-4
autonomous stage}{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-4  of learning. Here the skill has become almost }{\*\cs52\fs20\b0\i\expnd-1\expndtw-4 automatic,}
{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-4  or habitual. People in this stage do not consciously think about their movements while performing the skill, because they can perform it without conscious thought. They often can do another task at the same time; for example, they can carry on a conversation while typing or walking. Performance variability during this stage is very small: skilled people perform the skill consistently well from one attempt to the next. Additionally, these skilled performers can detect many of their own errors and make the proper adjustments to correct them, although he or she will be unaware of many movement details because these details are now controlled automatically. Fitts and Posner pointed out the likelihood that not every person learning a skill will reach this autonomous stage. The quality of instruction and practice as well as the amount of practice are important factors determining achievement of this final stage. In the final section of this chapter we will examine Ericsson\rquote s (1998) unique interpretation \line of how experts negotiate the autonomous stage \line of learning.}
{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-4 \par }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1 It is important to think of the three stages of the Fitts and Posner model as parts of a continuum of practice time, as depicted in figure 12.1. }
{\fs20 The amount of time a person will be in each stage depends on the skill being learned and the practice conditions, as well as the characteristics of the person. Individual differences can influence one person to spend more time in a specific stage than another person. Similarly, the same person could spend more time in one stage for one type of skill than for another type of skill. It is also important to note that people who are learning a skill }
{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1 do not make abrupt shifts from one stage to the next, though qualitative leaps in performance are not uncommon within each stage (Anderson, 2000; Bernstein, 1996). There is \line typically a gradual transition or change of the }

{\fs20 Another model that motor learning researchers commonly refer to was proposed by Ann Gentile (1972, 1987, 2000).

{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-3 In what Gentile labeled the }{\*\cs52\fs20\b0\i\expnd-1\expndtw-3 initial stage,}{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-3
 the beginner has }{\*\cs52\fs20\b0\i\expnd-1\expndtw-3 two important goals}{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-3  to achieve. One is to acquire a }
{\*\cs52\fs20\b0\i\expnd-1\expndtw-3 movement }{\*\cs52\fs20\b0\i\expnd0\expndtw-2 pattern}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2  that will allow some degree of success at achieving the action goal of the skill. This means that the beginner must develop movement characteristics that match the regulatory conditions of the environmental context in which the skill is performed. Recall from the discussion of Gentile\rquote s taxonomy of motor skills in chapter 1 of this text that the term }
{\*\cs52\fs20\b0\i\expnd0\expndtw-2 regulatory conditions}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2  refers to those characteristics of the environmental context to which movement characteristics must conform if the action goal is to be accomplished. For example, if\u8239 ?
a person is beginning to rehabilitate his or her prehension skills, he or she must focus on deve\u173 ?loping the arm and hand movement charac\u173 ?
teristics that match the physical characteristics \u173 ?associated with the object to be grasped. If, in the prehension example, the person must reach and grasp a cup that is on a table, the regulatory conditions include the size and shape of the cup, location of the cup, amount and type of liquid in the cup, and so on.\par }
\pard\plain \s12\f4\fs20\ltrpar\qj\fi240\li0\ri0\sb0\sa0\tx240\facenter\sl240\slmult0\expnd0\expndtw0\cf0\up0\charscalex100\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\accnone\hyphpar1\lang1033
{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw2 The second goal of the beginner is to learn to }{\*\cs52\fs20\b0\i\expnd0\expndtw2 discriminate between regulatory and \u173 ?
nonregulatory conditions}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw2  in the environmental context in which he or she performs the skill. Unlike regulatory conditions, the }
{\*\cs52\fs20\b0\i\expnd0\expndtw2 nonregulatory conditions}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw2  are those characteristics of the performance environment that have no influence or only an indirect influence on the movement characteristics required to achieve an action goal. To continue with the example of reaching and grasping a cup, the color of the cup or the shape of the table the cup is on are nonrelevant pieces of information for reaching for and grasping the cup, and therefore do not influence the movements used to perform the\u8239 ?
skill.}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw2 \par To achieve these two important goals, the beginner explores a variety of movement possibilities. Through trial and error, he or she experiences movement characteristics that match and do not match \u173 ?
requirements of the regulatory conditions. In addition, because the learner must solve numerous problems to determine how to achieve the action goal, he or she engages in a large amount of cognitive problem-solving activity. When the learner reaches the end of this stage, he or she has developed a movement pattern that allows some action goal achievement, but this achievement is neither consistent nor efficient. As Gentile (2000) described it, \ldblquote Although the learner now has a general concept of an effective approach, he or she is not skilled. The action-goal is not achieved consistently and the movement lacks efficiency\rdblquote  (p. 149).}

{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw1 In a chapter titled \ldblquote On Exercise and Skill\rdblquote  republished in a book titled }{\*\cs52\fs20\b0\i\expnd0\expndtw1
On Dexterity and Its Development}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw1  (1996), Bernstein provided one of the most comprehensive descriptions of how difficult it is to acquire a new skill. }
{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw1 He proposed}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw1  that learning a skill is similar to solving a problem, }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw1
and}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw1  likened the process of solving the problem to staging a play, }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw1 in which}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw1
 the }{\*\cs52\fs20\b0\i\expnd0\expndtw1 first}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw1  decision is }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw1 to determine }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw1
which level in the motor control system will take the leading role in the performance. Bernstein argued that the level of Actions typically takes the lead, directing }
{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw1 other}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw1  levels that have as their responsibility coordinating movements with external space, organizing muscular synergies, and regulating muscle tone. The }
{\*\cs52\fs20\b0\i\expnd0\expndtw1 second}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw1  phase involves developing a plan or strategy to approach the problem (specifying how the skill will look from the outside) and recruiting and assigning roles to the lower levels of the motor control system. The }
{\*\cs52\fs20\b0\i\expnd0\expndtw1 third}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw1  phase involves identifying the most appropriate sensory corrections (specifying how the skill should feel from the inside). During these initial }
{\*\cs52\fs20\b0\i\expnd0\expndtw1 planning}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw1  phases, the learner may consciously direct attention to the numerous details associated with controlling the movement}

{\fs20 In the }{\*\cs52\fs20\b0\i fourth}{\fs20  phase, the corrections are handed over to the background levels and so are typically engaged without conscious awareness. Bernstein thought that the background corrections were close to independent motor skills (automatisms) in their own right and so capable of being used in more than one movement, though often only after modification. Automatization of the skill becomes complete when the background level is mature enough to break free from the support provided by the leading level. It represents an }
{\*\cs52\fs20\b0\i\expnd0\expndtw0 ah ha!}{\fs20  moment; a qualitative leap forward. The }{\*\cs52\fs20\b0\i next phase}{\fs20  is gradual and involves achieving a harmony among the background corrections. Compared to the staging of a play, if the earlier phases were spent on assigning roles to the players, rewriting the script, and learning the lines by heart, then this phase would be viewed as rehearsals in which all of the elements must mutually adjust to each other. The learner may experience delays, hesitations, and even regressions in skill during this phase}
{\fs20 ;}{\fs20  however, such temporary setbacks are typically followed by major leaps forward in automatization. \par }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2
The final two phases involve }{\*\cs52\fs20\b0\i\expnd0\expndtw-2 standardization}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2  and }{\*\cs52\fs20\b0\i\expnd0\expndtw-2
stabilization}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2 . }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2 Standardization involves the}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2  reaction forces among the joints often }
{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2 taking}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2  the place of sensory corrections in counteracting external forces that would otherwise interfere with the movement. In many skills, this change leads to a form of dynamic stability that is accompanied by an enormous reduction in effort. The }
{\*\cs52\fs20\b0\i\expnd-1\expndtw-3 final phase}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2  is the stabilization of the skill against a disturbance or a change in the external conditions. The learner is now able to cope with various disruptions and prevent the skill from becoming deautomatized. \par }
{\fs20 The process that Bernstein describes is clearly complex and arduous. }{\*\cs52\fs20\b0\i Repetitions of a }{\*\cs52\fs20\b0\i
movement}{\*\cs52\fs20\b0\i  or action are necessary to solve the motor problem many times and to find the best way of solving it}
{\fs20  given the infinite number of external conditions one might encounter and the fact that movements }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw2
are never reproduced exactly. To solve the problem consistently, under a wide variety of conditions, and with an economy of effort, the learner must }

{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw2 This change in the rate of improvement during skill learning has a long and consistent history in motor learning. In fact, in 1926 Snoddy \u173 ?

{\fs20 Crossman (1959) reported what is today considered the classic experiment demonstrating the power law of practice. He examined the amount of time it took cigar makers to produce one cigar as a function of how many cigars each worker had made since beginning work at the factory. Some workers had made 10,000 cigars, whereas others had made over 10 million. The skill itself was a relatively simple one that could be done very quickly.

practice for these workers. As you can see in figure 12.2, the \u173 ?majority of all the improvement \u173 ?occurred during the\u8239 ?
first two years. After that, performance improvement increments were notably smaller.}{\fs20 \par }\pard\plain \s12\f4\fs20\ltrpar\qj\fi240\li0\ri0\sb0\sa0\tx240\facenter\sl240\slmult0\expnd0\expndtw0\cf0\up0\charscalex100\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\accnone\hyphpar1\lang1033
{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1 In a more recent demonstration of the power law of practice, Chen, Liu, Mayer-Kress, and Newell (2005) had participants learn to perform a pedalo locomotion task. The pedalo is a commercially available device that has two plastic pedals, on\u8239 ?
which a person stands; these are connected to four\u8239 ?wheels \u173 ?by\u8239 ?two iron rods that act like cranks and go through the pedals. The task is to stand on the\u8239 ?
plastic pedals and move them with the feet so that the wheels move \u173 ?forward or backward. The task \u173 ?involves \u173 ?dynamic \u173 ?
balance and requires coordination of the torso and limbs to keep the pedalo moving. For the experiment, the participants\rquote  goal was to achieve the fastest movement time (MT) they could while moving as smoothly as possible for a speci}
{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1 f}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1 ied distance. They practiced the task for fifty trials a day for seven \u173 ?
days.\u8239 ?The results showed that MT \u173 ?decreased during practice in a pattern that was consistent with the power law of practice. This means that MT \u173 ?
decreased \u173 ?rapidly on the first two days, but then decreased very little for the remaining practice trials.}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1
\par }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1 The difference in rate of improvement between early and later practice is due partly to the amount of improvement possible at a given time. Initially, there is room for a large amount of improvement. The errors people make during early practice trials are large and lead to many unsuccessful attempts at performing the skill. Because many of these errors are easy to correct, the learner can experience a large amount of improvement quickly. However, as practice continues, the amount of improvement possible decreases. The errors people make later in practice are much smaller. As a result, their \u173 ?
correction of these errors yields a smaller amount of improvement than they experienced earlier in practice. And certainly from the learner\rquote s perspective, attaining notable improvement seems to take longer than it did before.\par }

{\fs20 Bernstein, whom we noted in chapter 5 first identified this problem, described a strategy \u173 ?beginners \line typically use to gain initial control of the many degrees of freedom associated with performing a complex motor skill (Bernstein, 1967; Whiting, 1984). This strategy, which researchers now refer to\u8239 ?
as }{\f3\fs20\b\i0 freezing the degrees of freedom, }{\fs20 involves holding some joints rigid (i.e., \ldblquote freezing\rdblquote  them) and/or coupling joint motions together in tight synchrony while performing the skill. For example, suppose a beginner must perform a skill such as a racquetball or squash \u173 ?
forehand shot, which, at the joint level, involves the coordination of three degrees of freedom for the arm used to hit the ball: the wrist, elbow, and shoulder joints. A common strategy the beginner uses to control these joints so that he or she can hit the ball is to keep the wrist and elbow joints \ldblquote locked}
{\fs20 \rdblquote  (i.e., \ldblquote frozen\rdblquote ). This strategy makes the arm and hand move as if they were a stick, with the arm and hand segments acting as \line one segment.\par As the person practices the skill, a freeing of the degrees of freedom emerges as the }
{\fs20 \ldblquote frozen\rdblquote  joints begin to become \ldblquote unfrozen\rdblquote  and operate in a way that allows the arm and hand segments to function as a multisegment unit. This new unit eventually demonstrates characteristics of a }
{\*\cs52\fs20\b0\i functional synergy,}{\fs20  which means that the individual arm and hand segments work together in a cooperative way to \u173 ?
enable optimal performance of the skill. It is interesting to note that Southard and Higgins (1987) \u173 ?reported evidence demonstrating this kind of strategy and coordination development for the arm movement of the racquetball forehand shot. They showed that a primary benefit of the development of the functional synergy of the arm segments was an increase in racquet velocity at ball impact.}
{\fs20 \par Researchers have demonstrated similar coordination development characteristics for several other skills. For example, Anderson and Sidaway (1994) }
{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw1 showed that when beginning soccer players initially }{\fs20 tried to kick a ball forcefully, they limited the \u173 ?
movements of their hip and knee joints. The problem with this strategy is that it limits the velocity that can be generated by the foot because the knee joint and shank are unable to exploit the momentum of the thigh. With practice, however, players\rquote  kicking velocity increased, as their hip and knee joints acquired greater freedom of \u173 ?
movement and increased functional synergy. These results were described in figure 5.2, which portrayed the pre- and }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1
post-practice knee-and-hip relationship results from}{\fs20  this study }{\fs20 as an example of a graphic representation of coordination patterns}
{\fs20 .\par With continued practice, the learner ultimately develops a coordination pattern that is dynamically stable and more economical. Economy increases because the coordination pattern now exploits passive forces, like gravity, inertia, and reactive forces, to meet the task demands. Consequently, the contribution of active muscular forces is diminished.\par These kinds of coordination changes are not limited to sports skills or to people acquiring new skills. Stroke patients going through physical therapy to help them move from sitting to standing and then to sitting again, show coordina-\line tion development characteristics similar to those of people \u173 ?
acquiring a new skill (Ada, O\rquote Dwyer, }{\fs20 & Neilson, 1993). In this experiment, recovering stroke patients progressed from being able to sit-stand-sit without assistance one time to being able to perform this sequence three times in a row in 10 sec. As the patients progressed, the coordination between the hip and the knee joints showed marked improvement which demonstrated the \u173 ?
development of the functional synergy required for these joints to allow unaided standing.\par }\pard\plain \s12\f4\fs20\ltrpar\qj\fi240\li0\ri0\sb0\sa0\tx240\facenter\sl240\slmult0\expnd0\expndtw0\cf0\up0\charscalex100\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\accnone\hyphpar1\lang1033
{\fs20 The development of independent walking represents an excellent example of how the coordination pattern can exploit passive forces and minimize energy costs. During the stance phase of walking, the center of mass (COM) vaults over a relatively rigid leg like an inverted pendulum. There is an exchange between the potential energy and the kinetic energy of the COM during each step, with potential energy being highest when the COM is at its highest point and kinetic energy being highest when the COM is at its lowest point. Though adults are very good at recovering mechanical energy during walking, Ivanenko et al. (2004) showed that the percentage of mechanical energy recovery in toddlers was about 50 percent of what it was in older children and adults. This finding suggests that young walkers must learn the appropriate intersegmental coordination to exploit the pendulum mechanism to recover mechanical energy during walking. Patients who have had one or both legs amputated and who are learning to walk with lower limb prostheses for the first time are likely to encounter the same problems as the toddler learning to walk. Because the stiffness of the prosthetic limb, particularly the ankle-foot prosthesis, will be very different from the stiffness of the anatomical limb, the patient will likely need some time to learn how to exploit the energy storing and releasing elements that are built into the prosthesis.}
{\fs24 }{\f2\fs18\b0\i \par }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw1 An important feature of coordination changes during learning is their relationship to observed performance. Recall that according to Gentile\rquote s stages of learning model the beginner works on achieving action goal success, which is typically seen in performance outcome measures \line (e.g., increasing the number of free throws made with a basketball). As the person improves his or her performance in terms of action goal achievement, there are underlying coordination changes occurring. During the initial stage of learning these co\u8209 ?
\line ordination changes establish an \ldblquote in-the-ballpark\rdblquote  \line but unstable and inefficient movement pattern. It is during the later stages of learning that the movement pattern stabilization process occurs to allow consistent and efficient performance of the skill.\par }

control problem \line presumably because it reduces the number of components that need to be controlled. As degrees of freedom are released, the underlying control mechanism should become more complex because more degrees of freedom now need to be regulated. Newell and Vaillancourt (2001) have argued, however, that the number of degrees of freedom and the complexity of the underlying control mechanism can either increase or decrease during learning depending on the many constraints that surround the task. They also note that there is often no obvious relation between the number of degrees of freedom that are regulated and the complexity of the control mechanism.}

{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1 has developed a rather large repertoire of movement }{\fs20 patterns that we prefer to use. When confronted with learning a new skill, we often determine that it resembles a skill we already know how to perform. As a result, we typically begin practicing the new skill using movement characteristics similar to those of the skill we already know.

{\fs20 When a person is learning a new skill that requires altering an established coordination pattern, an interesting transition from old to new pattern occurs. The experiment by Lee, Swinnen, and Verschueren (1995) that we discussed in chapter 11 provides a good example of this change. Recall that participants had to learn to bimanually move two levers simultaneously in a 90-degree out-of-phase \line arm movement relationship in order to draw ellipses on the computer monitor. In chapter 11, figure 11.4 showed that when they first were confronted with this task, the participants\rquote  preferred way of coordinating their arms was to move both arms at the same time, producing diagonal patterns. The influence of this preferred movement pattern remained for more than sixty practice trials. Participants did not consistently produce the new coordination pattern until they had performed 180 practice trials. Instability characterized the coordination patterns they produced on trials between these two demonstrations of stable patterns.\par }
{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2 The experiment by Lee and colleagues demonstrates several things. First, it shows that people \u173 ?approach skill learning situations with distinct movement pattern biases that they may need to overcome to achieve the goal of the skill to be learned. Second, it is possible for people to overcome these biases, but often this takes considerable practice (the actual amount varies among people). Finally, as illustrated in figure 11.4, an observable pattern of stability-instability-stability characterizes the transition between production of the \u173 ?
preferred movement pattern and production of the goal pattern. The initially preferred and the newly acquired goal movement patterns are distinguished by unique but stable kinematic characteristics over repeated performances. However, during the transition period between these stable patterns, the limb kinematics are very irregular or unstable.}
{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2 \par }{\fs20 People who provide skill instruction should note that this transition period can be a difficult and \u173 ?
frustrating time for the learner. Sometimes it is necessary to go backward before one can go forward. The instructor or therapist who is aware of this can be influential in helping the person work through this transition stage. One helpful strategy is providing extra motivational encouragements to keep the person effectively engaged in practice.\par }

{\fs20 Practitioners should also be aware that modifying coordination patterns can influence the stability of neighboring coordination patterns. Zanone and Kelso (1992, 1997) have shown that the nature of the learner\rquote s initial coordination tendencies, which they labeled }
{\*\cs52\fs20\b0\i intrinsic dynamics}{\fs20 , will determine which patterns become more stable or less stable when new patterns of coordination are acquired. We introduced the concept of intrinsic dynamics in chapter 11 and will examine it further in the next chapter on transfer of learning.\par }

{\fs20 If practicing a skill results in coordination changes, we should expect a related change in the muscles a person uses while performing the skill. EMG patterns produced while people practiced skills have shown that early in practice a person uses his or her muscles inappropriately. Two characteristics are particularly noteworthy. First, more muscles than are needed commonly are involved. Second, the timing of the activation of the involved muscle groups is incorrect. As a person continues to practice, the number of muscles involved decreases so\u8239 ?}

{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2 Researchers have provided evidence showing these types of change during practice for a variety of physical activities. For example, muscle activation changes have been demonstrated for sport skills such as the single-knee circle mount on the horizontal \u173 ?
bar\u8239 ?in gymnastics (Kamon & Gormley, 1968), ball throwing to a target (Vorro, Wilson, & Dainis, 1978), dart throwing (Jaegers et al., 1989), the smash stroke in badminton (Sakuari }

the lunge in fencing (Williams & \u173 ?Walmsley, 2000). Also, researchers have shown muscle activation \u173 ?differences resulting from practice in laboratory tasks, such as complex, rapid arm movement and manual aiming tasks (Schneider et al., 1989), as\u8239 ?
well as simple, rapid elbow flexion tasks (Gabriel & Boucher, 1998) and arm-extension tasks (Moore & Marteniuk, 1986). }{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-4

\par }{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-3 The change in muscle use that occurs while a person learns a skill reflects the }{\*\cs52\fs20\b0\i\expnd-1\expndtw-4

{\*\cs52\fs20\b0\i\expnd0\expndtw-2 mechanical energy}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2  while performing; scientists determine this by dividing the work rate by the metabolic rate of the individual.

{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1 Researchers have been accumulating evidence only recently to support the prediction that energy cost decreases as a result of practicing a skill. For example, }

{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\u173 ?}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1 Newell, 1994) demonstrated that oxygen use, heart rate, and }{\*\cs52\fs20\b0\i

The beginners typically use more oxygen for the same length of dive.\par }
{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2 In addition to demonstrating a reduction in energy \line }{\fs20 cost, learners also experience a decrease in their rate of perceived exertion (RPE).

{\fs20 We see an everyday example of this change }{\fs20 \line }{\fs20 in the process of learning to shift gears in a standard shift car. If you have learned to drive a standard }
{\fs20 \line }{\fs20 shift car, you undoubtedly remember how you approached shifting gears when you first learned to do so. Each part of the maneuver required your conscious attention. You thought about each part of the entire sequence of movements: when to lift off the accelerator, when to push in the clutch, how to coordinate your leg movements to carry out these clutch and accelerator actions, when and where to move the gear shift, when to let out the clutch, and finally, when to depress the accelerator again. But what happened as you became a more experienced driver? Eventually, you performed all these movements without conscious attention. In fact, you undoubtedly found that you were able to do something else at the same time, such as carry on a conversation or sing along with the radio. You would have had great difficulty doing any of these things while shifting when you were first learning to drive. Evidence that this type of attention-\u173 ?
demand change occurs with experience was provided by Shinar, Meir, and Ben-Shoham (1998) in a study that compared experienced and novice \u173 ?
licensed car drivers in Israel. Results showed that while shifting gears, the novice drivers tended to miss traffic signs that the experienced drivers did not miss.}
{\fs20 \par }{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-3 An experiment that compared novice and skilled baseball batters also demonstrates the change in conscious attention demands that occurs across the learning stages continuum. Gray (2004) had \ldblquote skilled\rdblquote  university and \ldblquote novice\rdblquote  recreational baseball players hit simulated baseball pitches that varied in speed and height. On some trials the players only swung at the pitches. On other trials, they had to perform a secondary task in response to an audible tone. One type of secondary task, which was extraneous to the hitting skill, required the players to verbally identify the tone as high or low. The other type of secondary task, which was related to the hitting skill, required the players to \u173 ?
verbally identify whether the bat was moving up or down at the time of the tone. The tone occurred at any time after the ball appeared to the batter. The results showed that the extraneous secondary task led to an increase in swing errors for novice players but not for skilled players. But, when asked about the movement of the bat, just the opposite occurred as swing errors increased for skilled but not for novice players. Thus skilled players had reduced the conscious attention demanded by swinging the bat and could respond to the tone without disrupting their swing. In contrast, their swing was disrupted when they had to attend to how their bat was moving, something they did not normally do. On the other hand, the novice players were not disrupted when asked about the movement of their bat because the secondary task required them to respond to something they typically gave attention to when swinging at a pitch.}
{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-3  Interestingly, individuals with a higher propensity to consciously control their movements when learning a new skill have also been shown to have a higher propensity to freeze degrees of freedom (van Ginneken et al., 2018).}
{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-3 \par }{\fs20 Finally, consider some experiences that you or your friends have had with learning motor skills. If\u8239 ?
you learned to type on a computer keyboard, on your first attempts to type a word or sentence you undoubtedly directed your conscious attention to each finger hitting the correct key for every letter. You probably could not carry on a conversation with a friend while you were typing because the typing task demanded all your attention. But, as you practiced and became more skilled, you no longer needed to direct your attention to your fingers and the keys for each letter, and you could talk with a friend while you typed. Similarly, when athletic trainers first learn to tape an ankle, they direct their conscious attention to the application of each strip of tape to make sure it is located properly and applied smoothly. But after a lot of practice taping ankles, trainers no longer need to direct all their attention to these aspects of taping. You can probably think of additional situations that resemble these. The examples demonstrate that a common characteristic of learning a motor skill is that the amount of conscious attention demanded by the movements of the skill itself decreases as the learner progresses along the stages of a learning continuum and becomes more skillful.\par }

However, for rapid movements, such as initiating and carrying out a swing at a baseball, a person often cannot make the correction in time during the execution of the swing because the ball has moved past a hittable location by the time the person makes the correction.

{\fs20 With the advent of brain imaging technology, an impressive number of researchers have been actively investigating the changes in brain activity \u173 ?

{\*\cs52\fs20\b0\i\expnd0\expndtw-2 }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2 Finally, two other points are important to note regarding learning-induced changes in the brain. First, the automatization of motor skills is \u173 ?
associated with an overall reduction in cortical activity, suggesting improvements in processing efficiency that are consistent with efficiency gains in other systems during motor skill learning (Gobel, }
{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2 Parrish}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2 , & Reber, 2011). Second, the brain undergoes structural changes in addition to functional changes when new skills are learned. In one of the first demonstrations of such changes, Draganski et al. (2004) showed that three months of juggling practice led to a significant, though temporary, bilateral increase in the density of gray matter in the midtemporal area and in the left posterior intraparietal sulcus. Both of these areas are associated with the processing and retention of visual information. Subsequent research has confirmed that similar changes occur when other complex motor skills are acquired and that the organization of white matter pathways also change with practice (see Zatorre, Fields, & Johansen-Berg, 2012, for an excellent review of work in this area}
{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2  and Steele & Zatorre, 2018, for a discussion of current directions in this line of research}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2

{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2 Another method used to examine structural and/or functional changes in the brain associated with motor learning is to examine the brains of elite athletes in a resting state or when engaged in motor imagery or rehearsal of performance. This method is consistent with studies described at the end of the chapter that focus on how experts differ from non-experts on a range of perceptual, cognitive, and motor measures. Neuroplastic differences in brain structure and/or function have been observed in archers (Chang et al., 2011; Kim et al., 2008, 2014), badminton players (Di et al., 2012), basketball players (Park et al., 2009, 2015), dancers (Calvo-Merino et al., 2005; Giacosa et al., 2016; H}

Consistent with the idea that long-term training induces changes in neural processing efficiency, the world-class gymnasts studied by Huang et al. (2018) showed significantly lower resting state intra-network functional connectivity in the basal ganglia, the anterior default mode network, and the left and right fronto-}
{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2 parietal}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2  }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2 networks, though functional connectivity was higher in the extrastriate visual network, compared to non-athlete controls. In addition, the gymnasts showed lower inter-network functional connectivity between the sensorimotor network and the basal ganglia, cerebellum, and primary visual networks, between the basal ganglia network and the primary visual network, and between the posterior default mode network and the right fronto-parietal network than controls. Again, these findings do not imply the brain regions studied were not as connected as they were in controls; the regions were simply less active in the resting state as a result of greater efficiency in the gymnasts\rquote  brains.\par }

{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2 Researchers who have investigated the use of sensory feedback across the stages of learning have consistently shown that }
{\*\cs52\fs20\b0\i\expnd0\expndtw-2 learning is specific to the sources of sensory feedback available during practice.}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2
 This means that if we use visual feedback \u173 ?during practice in the first stage of learning, we continue to need to use it in the same way as we \u173 ?
become more skillful in later stages. Proteau and Marteniuk (1993) presented a good example of \u173 ?research evidence of this feedback dependency. \line They allowed participants to see their movements as they }
{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2 learned}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2  to perform a 90 cm aiming movement in 550 msec. Then, after 200 or 2,000 practice trials, the visual feedback was removed. We would expect that if the participants had learned to rely on sensory feedback sources other than \u173 ?
vision as they practiced, increasing the amount of practice with vision would decrease \line the need for \u173 ?vision to perform the skill. However, the results showed just the opposite effects. Participants who had visual feedback removed after 2,000 trials performed less accurately than those who had it \u173 ?
removed after 200 trials. Rather than decreasing their dependency on visual feedback, the participants increased dependency. Similar results were reported for participants learning the same type of manual aiming task with visual feedback but then having it removed after 100, 1,300, and 2,100 \line trials (Khan, Franks, & Goodman, 1998). Other types of motor skills have also shown this effect, such as walking across a balance beam (which you saw in the preceding section), walking a specific distance on a narrow line on the floor (Proteau, Tremblay, & DeJaeger, 1998), a serial arm \u173 ?

{\fs20 Why does dependency increase for sensory feedback sources available during practice as a \u173 ?person advances through the stages of learning? Proteau and his colleagues hypothesize that the \u173 ?

Ericsson argues that during the learning of everyday skills, people reach an acceptable level of performance and are then happy to devote minimal attention to the skill, consequently losing conscious control over modifying it. The skill often stagnates in this scenario even though the learner continues to practice it. In contrast, the expert attempts to avoid the stagnation associated with complete automaticity }

{\fs18\expnd0\expndtw0 Steve Blass was a professional baseball player who }{\fs18\expnd0\expndtw0 pitched}{\fs18\expnd0\expndtw0
 for the Pittsburgh Pirates. Over a ten-year career he had over 100 wins, made the National League All-Star team, and finished second in the voting for the 1971 World Series MVP, behind his teammate Roberto Clemente. Despite his stellar career, Steve Blass is best remembered for his sudden and bizarre loss of control over his pitches during the 1973 season. He walked a significant number of batters, struck out very few, and had an ERA that shot up to 9.81. He spent the majority of the 1974 season in the minor leagues and then retired in 1975. Steve Blass disease is now commonly used in baseball circles to refer to a highly skilled pitcher who abruptly and inexplicably loses the ability to control his throws.\par }

{\fs18 Coaches, commentators, and researchers have proposed various explanations for Steve Blass\rquote s precipitous loss of skill in pitching the baseball; however, most center on the detrimental effects associated with focusing on the throwing mechanics during the pitch. In chapter 9, you learned that focusing on movements rather than movement effects has a detrimental effect on performance and often leads to choking. Whether or not this explanation is correct is open to speculation. Blass, himself, said that he tried a multitude of remedies to deal with his malady, but to no avail\'d1absolutely nothing worked. Given the number of high-profile performers and athletes who have suffered similar precipitous and unexplained losses in skill, this area is ripe for additional research. The topic of loss of skill is rarely considered in the skill acquisition literature.\par To hear an interesting interview with Steve Blass about Steve Blass disease, go to http://www\line .thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/462\line /own-worst-enemy?act=1.
