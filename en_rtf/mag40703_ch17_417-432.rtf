{\fs18\expnd-1\expndtw-3 Teachers, coaches, and therapists must make important decisions about the amount of practice people should engage in, as well as how much time to devote to various activities within and across practice sessions within the total amount of practice time available. In terms of the amount of practice needed to learn a skill, the conventional wisdom seems to be that the more practice a person has, the better his or her performance will be in some future situation. Consider some examples. It seems likely that a dance teacher would encourage a dancer who was a bit tentative in certain parts of a routine to spend as much time as possible going over the routine repeatedly in practice. A golf instructor would probably try to help a person be more successful }
{\fs18\expnd-1\expndtw-3 with a certain shot}{\fs18\expnd-1\expndtw-3  by encouraging the person to spend as much time as possible on the practice }

\rdblquote  But ironically, although this }{\fs18\expnd-1\expndtw-3 view of practice}{\fs18\expnd-1\expndtw-3  seems logical, research indicates that it is not always the best alternative.

{\fs18 The amount of practice a person devotes to a skill is critical for learning motor skills. This is especially the case when the person has the attaining of expertise as a goal. As we discussed in chapter 12, the impressive work by Ericsson and others has shown that expertise in any field is the result of intense practice for a minimum of ten years (Ericsson et al., 1993). Clearly, for achieving expertise, more practice is better than less. However, the amount of practice required to attain expertise is not our focus here. Instead, we will focus on the amount of practice a person needs to ensure achieving a specific performance goal associated with a specific period of practice.\par }

{\fs18\expnd0\expndtw-2 There are many situations in which it is important to determine the amount of practice people should experience to achieve specific skill performance goals. Although limitations may exist in many of these situations in terms of the amount of time available for practice, the need to determine the amount of practice required remains. For example, a physical education teacher needs to determine the number of classes within a unit to devote to learning a specific activity. In sports settings, the amount of practice time available is typically restricted by a season\rquote s schedule or by rules }
{\fs18\expnd0\expndtw2 established by professional associations. And, in }{\fs18\expnd0\expndtw-2 rehabilitation contexts, the amount of time available for therapy is typically restricted by health care provider agencies.\par }

{\fs18 As we address the issue of optimal amounts of practice, we will limit our discussion to these types of situations and establish some guidelines for the effective and efficient use of available practice time.

strengthen the generalized motor program and }{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-3 response schema for the skill a person is learning, so that the person can call it into action more readily when necessary.

{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-4 Driskell, Willis, and Copper (1992) reviewed and analyzed fifteen research studies that investigated several hypotheses related to overlearning. The first notable point about this review is that the issue of overlearning has not generated a great deal of research over the years. The fifteen studies covered research articles published from 1929 to 1982. However, these studies involved almost 4,000 subjects, which gives us a good basis for discerning the influence of overlearning on skill acquisition and how various factors influence overlearning. The results of this review indicated that for motor skill learning, overlearning has a positive influence on retention performance. And when extra practice of 50 to 200 percent was analyzed, the higher percentages resulted in relatively proportionate higher retention test performance.\par }
{\fs20 Although the Driskell et al. (1992) review provides a comprehensive overview of overlearning as it relates to skill acquisition, it does not evaluate \u173 ?
effects related to specific types of motor skills. \u173 ?Because motor learning research has shown that certain types of skills demonstrate some distinct characteristics with regards to over\u173 ?

{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-3 Although this term was not included in chapter 1 in the discussion of types of skills, it is a relatively common term used in the training and functional skills literature.}
{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-3  It typically requires a person to perform a series of movements that individually are relatively easy to execute. However, to accomplish }
{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw1 the total task, the performer must know which }{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-3 movements to make and in what order. These types of skills are especially common in occupational, industrial, and military settings. For example, peo}

{\fs20\expnd1\expndtw4 A common problem with procedural skills is }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1 that people tend to forget what to do to carry out the entire procedure. This is particularly characteristic of procedural skills that they do not perform }
{\fs20\expnd1\expndtw4 routinely every day. For example, several years }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1 ago, the U.S. Army was interested in improving the performance of soldiers for a procedural skill that involved assembling and disassembling machine guns. This skill was important to study because soldiers typically learned it in a short training period, but did not perform it again until sometime after training; it was not a routine part of their daily duties. The problem was that when they performed a later test on this skill, the soldiers typically showed a large decrement in performance, compared to how they had performed at the end of }
{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw2 training. \line To overcome this problem, researchers }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1 for \line the U.S. Army Research Institute (Schendel & \u173 ?
Hagman, 1982) \u173 ?proposed that an overlearning training strategy (which they referred}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1  to as }{\*\cs47\fs20\b0\i\expnd0\expndtw-1
overtraining}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1 ) would be effective for decreasing the amount the soldiers forgot about the procedure.\par }
{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-4 The researchers compared two forms of overtraining to a no-overtraining situation. One form was an \ldblquote imme\u173 ?
diate\rdblquote  overtraining condition, which required soldiers to }{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-4 perform 100 percent more trials than they required to achieve a performance criterion of one correct \u173 ?
assembly/disassembly trial. The second overtraining condition also involved an additional 100 percent more practice trials, but these trials were administered as \ldblquote refresher\rdblquote  training midway through the eight-week retention interval used for all subjects. Results showed that both of these overtraining groups performed better than the no-overtraining control group on the retention test, which required the soldiers to practice until they were again able to assemble and disassemble the gun correctly on a trial. However, the two overtraining groups did not differ from each other in the number of trials it took to retrain to the criterion performance of one correct trial.\par }
{\fs20\expnd1\expndtw4 Based on the results of this experiment, the }{\fs20 authors recommended the immediate overtraining procedure, because it was more cost- and time-\u173 ?
effective. Because the trainees were already in the training session, it would take less time and money to have them engage in additional practice there than to bring them back several weeks later for a \u173 ?

{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-5 investigated}{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-5  the use of overlearning for a dynamic balance skill. This experiment continues to be the only one reported in the research literature that involves the overlearning of dynamic balance skills.

In this experiment, people practiced balancing on a stabilome\u173 ?

trials in one of the following amounts: 0 percent (none), 50 percent, 100 percent, or 200 percent of the initial number of trials of practice. Then, all \u173 ?

{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1 beyond what they needed to achieve the performance criterion performed better on the retention }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw1
tests. More interesting, however, was the result }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1 that there was }{\*\cs47\fs20\b0\i\expnd0\expndtw-2 a point of diminishing returns}
{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1  for the amount of retention performance benefit in relation to the amount of extra practice. This effect can be seen in the results when the group that had 50 percent additional practice did as well\u8239 ?

{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2 Researchers also have demonstrated the presence of the \ldblquote diminishing returns\rdblquote  phenomenon for learning skills in physical education classes. A good example of this is an experiment by Goldberger and Gerney (1990). In a unit of instruction, fifth-grade boys and girls practiced several football skills. The goal of this unit was to help students improve their performance of these skills. To simplify matters, we will look only at the two-step football punt. One group practiced these skills according to a teacher-rotated format, in which the teacher divided the class into five subgroups and assigned each to one of five stations where they practiced a specified skill for 5\u8239 ?}
{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2 min. At the end of every 5 min, students rotated to a new station. Another group of students practiced according to a learner-rotated format: They received index cards describing what they needed to do at each station and then were told to use their 25 min efficiently to practice each skill. Everyone practiced like this for two class periods on two days. The next week, the students performed the skills in a test.\par }

{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1 The results showed that the two groups differed in terms of the number of practice trials for this skill, but not in test performance. The teacher-\u173 ?
rotated format group actually practiced the skill an average of 7 more trials than the learner-rotated format group. Students in the learner-rotated format group performed from 0 to 67 trials, whereas students in the teacher-rotated group performed from 0 to 87 trials. But there was no difference between the groups in the amount of improvement in their punting performance scores. The additional }

{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2 Although the overlearning strategy typically benefits skill learning, some evidence shows that in addition to the diminishing returns phenomenon, learning deficits may result from providing }
{\*\cs47\fs20\b0\i\expnd-1\expndtw-3 too many }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2 extra practice trials. For example, Shea and Kohl (1990) reported an experiment in which }

A third group practiced the skill with the 175N goal force for 289 trials. One day later, all participants engaged in a retention test in which they performed the skill with the goal force of 175N for 10 trials.}
{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2 \par }\pard\plain \s13\f6\fs20\ltrpar\qj\fi240\li0\ri0\sb0\sa0\tx240\facenter\sl240\slmult0\expnd0\expndtw0\cf1\up0\charscalex100\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\accnone\hyphpar1\lang1033
{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2 The results showed that the group that practiced the 175N goal force for 289 trials had the poorest \line performance on the initial 5 trials of the retention test. In contrast, the group that practiced the variable goals performed best. Results for the group that practiced only 85 trials of the 175N goal fell between }
{\fs20\expnd1\expndtw4 those of the two other groups. The differences }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2 between these groups were most distinct on the first retention trial. However, on the final 5 trials of the retention test, all three groups performed similarly. These results were replicated in another experiment by the same authors (Shea & Kohl, 1991).\par }
{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-4 Similarly, Travlos (1999) also reported that increasing the amount of practice beyond a certain number of trials resulted in poorer transfer test performance. In this experiment, participants attempted to learn the distance of a horizontal line by touching a digitizing tablet with a stylus at locations they estimated to be the beginning and end of the line. Although they could not see their movements, the participants received knowledge of results (KR) about their estimate in terms of the distance it deviated from the 8 in. criterion. Five groups experienced different amounts of practice: 42, 77, 102, 127, and 152 trials. At the end of practice, they \u173 ?
performed a transfer test for five trials. This test \u173 ?required them to estimate the horizontal length of \u173 ?a\u8239 ?10 in. line. The results, which you can see in figure\u8239 ?
17.1}{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-4 , showed that at the end of practice, all groups performed similarly. However, performance on the transfer test showed the influence of the different amounts of practice. Those who practiced the task for 77 and 102 trials performed the transfer test with less error than those who did other amounts of practice trials. The transfer test results also showed that 42 practice trials were too few, and that 127 and 152 trials were too many, which means that additional practice beyond 102 trials led to a decrement in transfer test performance rather than an enhancement of it.\par }
{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-6 In a more recent study, Lee and colleagues (Lee, Bhatt, Liu, Wang, & Pai, 2018) reported that providing older adults (> 73 yrs old) with more than 24 trials of tripping practice on a treadmill did not improve incidence of falls, balance, or stability beyond the 24 trials.}
{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-6 \par }{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-4 The significance of the results reported in these experiments is that they run counter to what most people would expect, that the best way to improve performance is to increase the amount of practice. The research described in this section showed that the addition of more practice beyond a certain amount did not improve retention and transfer test performance.\par }
{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2 Why would more practice lead to poorer retention and transfer test performance than less practice? One reason could be that because the skills practiced in these experiments were so simple, boredom became a problem after a certain amount of practice. }
{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-3 As a result, the learners reduced the amount of attention}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2  the task required to improve performance. Or, as Lee, Swinnen, and Serrien (1994) described it, the learners ceased to engage in the amount of }

{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw2 A second explanation relates to both the motor program\'d0based and the dynamical systems theories concerning the importance of }
{\*\cs47\fs20\b0\i practice variability,}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw2  which you studied in chapter 16. According to these theories, continued practice of the same movement can result in a decreasing capability to remember the movement as well as to transfer to a movement variation, whereas the practice of variations of the movement results in enhancing the capability to \u173 ?

Similarly, if a dancer must perform in a concert that is one month away, then the rehearsal schedule must adjust accordingly.

{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw0 A classic example of research supporting this general conclusion is a study published many years ago by Baddely and Longman (1978). They were attempting to determine the best way to sched\u173 ?
ule\u8239 ?training sessions for postal workers on a mail-\u173 ?sorting machine, which required operating a typewriter-like keyboard. The postal service had allotted a total of 60 hours and 5 days each week for training the workers. Although this available training time could be distributed in a variety of ways in terms of number of training sessions, the researchers distributed this amount of time in four different ways, which are described in table 17.1 in the Practice Schedule column. Two groups trained for one hour in each session. One of these two groups practiced for only one session each day, which resulted in a total training time of twelve weeks, whereas the second group had two sessions each day, thereby reducing the number of weeks in training to 6. Two other groups practiced for two hours in each session. One of these groups had only one session each day, whereas the other had two sessions per day. These latter two groups therefore had six weeks and three weeks of training, respectively. These four schedules illustrate the variety of ways the researchers distributed 60 hours of practice. The }
{\*\cs47\fs20\b0\i\expnd0\expndtw0 most distributed schedule}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw0  required workers to train for twelve weeks, whereas the }
{\*\cs47\fs20\b0\i\expnd0\expndtw0 most massed schedule}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw0  allowed them to complete their training in only three weeks. \line The primary difference between these schedules was in how long each session was and how many sessions occurred each day.\par }
{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2 The results of this study are shown in table 17.1, \line }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw2 which}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw2
 describes the number of hours the }{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-3 trainees required to achieve a typing speed of 80 keystrokes per minute, which was the motor perfor\u173 ?
mance goal for their training. Notice that only one of the four schedules (the most distributed schedule) resulted in the workers achieving this goal in the allotted training time of 60 hours (they did it in 55 hours). The other three groups required additional practice time. It is interesting that those in the most massed schedule group, which practiced two \line 2-hour sessions each day, never achieved this goal. After 80\u8239 ?
hours of practice they were still doing only a little better than 70 keystrokes per minute.\par }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1 Retention tests were given 1, 3, and 9 months }
{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw2 after the workers had finished training. After \line 9 }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1 months, the most massed group performed worse on the typing speed test than the other groups, which performed about equally. Finally, the researchers obtained a very revealing result from the trainees\rquote  }
{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw2 own ratings of the training schedules. Although }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1 most workers preferred their own schedule, those in the most massed group preferred theirs the most, }
{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw2 whereas members of the most distributed liked }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1 theirs the least. Interestingly, these preferences were exactly opposite to the performance test results.}
{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1 \par }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw0 The results of this experiment indicate that fitting 60 hours of training into 3-week, where there had to be two 2-hour practice sessions each day, was a poor practice schedule.

Given all the results, the authors concluded that the one-hour training sessions were more desirable than the two-hour sessions, and that one session per day was only slightly more effective than two sessions per day. However, having two 2-hour sessions each day was not a good training schedule.\par }

Typists who practiced twelve skills during two sessions of 35 and 25 min each, separated by a 10 min break, required less time to learn the skills and had fewer errors on a test than typists who practiced the skills during one 60 min session.}
{\fs20 \par Shea et al. (2000) showed that distributing practice sessions across days resulted in better learning than massing all the sessions within one day for a continuous dynamic balance task and a discrete key-press timing task. The results for the continuous balance task are shown in figure 17.2. Note that for the first session of trials (each trial involved \line 90 sec of continuous balancing), both the one-day practice (massed) and the two-day practice (distributed) groups performed similarly. However, during the second practice session the groups began to perform differently. By the end of this session, the distributed group, for whom this session was the next day, had significantly less balancing error. }

{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw2 Finally, in a study involving learning to putt in golf, Dail and Christina (2004) had novice golfers practice putting a 3.7 m distance for 240 trials. One group followed a massed practice schedule in which they performed all the trials on one day, with short breaks between blocks of 10 trials.

{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw2 figure 17.3, showed that at the end of 240 practice trials, the distributed practice group performed at a higher level than the massed schedule group. More importantly, this difference continued one and seven days later on retention tests of 60 trials. It is also interesting to note that at the end of each block of 10 trials during the practice sessions the experimenters asked the participants to predict their performance on the retention test. For this assessment of their own competence (i.e., metacognition), the participants who experienced the distributed schedule more accurately predicted their retention test performance.\par }

{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2 There are at least three possible reasons why the distribution of practice sessions across more days leads to better learning than massing the sessions within fewer days. One is that }
{\*\cs47\fs20\b0\i\expnd-1\expndtw-3 fatigue}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2  negatively influences learning for massed practice schedules. Although none of the experiments discussed in this section assessed participants}
{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2 \rquote  levels of fatigue, it is possible to suspect that fatigue influenced learning because of the task performance requirements. For example, in the Shea et al. (2000) experiment, \u173 ?
participants performed a continuous dynamic balance task for 90 sec on each trial. The massed practice s\u173 ?chedule \u173 ?required them to perform 14 trials on the same day with only a 20 min break between trials 7 and\'ca8. On the other hand, participants in the distributed practice schedule performed the second set of seven \u173 ?
trials on the following day. Similarly in the Dail and Christina (2004) experiment, par}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw2 ticipants who experienced the massed practice }
{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2 schedule performed 240 putts in one session, with short rest breaks only after each set of 10 trials. In contrast, those who practiced according to the distributed schedule performed only 60 trials in each session.\par }

{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw0 Second, the massing of practice within a day or a few days may reduce the amount of }{\*\cs47\fs20\b0\i\expnd0\expndtw0
cognitive effort}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw0  used on each trial as practice continues beyond a certain critical amount. We considered this explanation earlier in this chapter when we discussed reasons why more practice beyond a certain amount could lead to diminished learning. The massing of practice trials may institute a practice condition in which performance of the skill on each trial becomes so repetitious that it becomes monotonous or boring. As a result, the learner begins to decrease the amount of cognitive effort involved in each trial, which in turn diminishes the level of learning.\par }
{\fs20\expnd1\expndtw3 The possibility that either or both fatigue and reduced cognitive effort accounted for the poorer learning that resulted from the massed compared to the distributed practice sessions can be seen in the results of the Shea et al. (2000) and Dail and Christina (2004) experiments. As you can see in }
{\fs20\expnd1\expndtw3 figure\'ca17.2, lower practice performance in }{\fs20\expnd1\expndtw3 the Shea et al. study}{\fs20\expnd1\expndtw3
 did not begin until the last several trials for the massed practice condition. This suggests that as participants continued to practice, the effects of fatigue and/or reduced cognitive effort eventually began to influence their performance in a negative way. And this influence affected not only their practice performance but also their retention test performance, indicating an influence on their learning \line the skills.\par }

{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw0 The third explanation relates to }{\*\cs47\fs20\b0\i\expnd0\expndtw0 memory consolidation,}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw0
 which is a long-term memory storage process. The memory consolidation hypothesis proposes that to store in memory the relevant information we need to learn a skill, certain neuro-\u173 ?
biochemical processes must occur. These processes, which transform a relatively unstable memory representation into a relatively permanent one, require a certain amount of time without additional practice of the same skill. The distribution of practice across several days provides a better opportunity for the memory consolidation process to take place than does the massing of practice within a day or a few days (see Brashers-Krug, Shadmehr, & Bizzi, 1996; Shadmehr & Brashers-Krug, 1997; }

{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw1 Two reviews of the distributed practice research literature have helped resolve these problems and }{\fs20\expnd1\expndtw4

\u8194\'20Continuous skills have been the most common type of motor skills used to investigate the effects of massed versus distributed practice between trials. And the most popular task has been the rotary pursuit task, in which a person must keep a handheld stylus in contact with a small disk on a rotating turntable for as long as possible. A trial is usually a specified length of time, such as 20 or 30 sec. What makes this type of task useful for investigating the issue of massed versus distributed practice is that it is quite easy to specify massed and distributed intertrial interval lengths. Massed practice schedules typically have few, if any, seconds of rest between trials, whereas the intervals in distributed schedules are as long as or longer than the trials themselves. Because of this, researchers can establish intertrial interval lengths that are readily identifiable as distinctly massed or distributed. The Lee and Genovese (1988) review found that the con\u173 ?

Discrete skills.}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw2 \u8194\'20When researchers use discrete skills to investigate the issue of intertrial massed versus distributed practice, a problem arises that is directly related to the definition problem we discussed earlier. If a massed schedule allows no rest between \u173 ?
trials, whereas a distributed schedule involves a rest interval that is the same length as the practice trial, then the two contrasted intertrial intervals will be essentially the same length, because a discrete response is typically very short. For example, if people are practicing a rapid-\u173 ?
aiming task that has a duration of approximately 150 msec, the distributed practice condition could, by definition, have a 150 msec intertrial interval. But if the massed condition had no rest between trials, only 150 msec would separate the two practice schedules. Thus, the operational definition of the terms \ldblquote massed\rdblquote  and \ldblquote distributed\rdblquote  becomes especially important in experiments using discrete tasks. Probably one reason this has not \u173 ?
troubled researchers is that discrete tasks seldom have been used for comparing massed to distributed practice. In fact, in their comprehensive review, Lee and Genovese (1988) found only one study in the research literature that used a discrete task (Carron, 1969). The results of that study, and one subsequently reported by Lee and Genovese (1989), provided evidence that }

{\f6\fs20\b0\i0\expnd0\expndtw2  Further support for this view was more recently provided in a study by Panchuk and colleagues (Panchuk, Spittle, Johnston, & Spittle, 2013) for learning a handball pass in }

These two issues are often overlooked as distinct even though research evidence supports the distinction. A significant reason for the distinction is that two different conclusions concerning how to best distribute practice are associated with each issue. When the length and frequency of practice sessions is the practice distribution concern, distributed practice results in better learning than massed practice, regardless of the type of skill being learned. On the other hand, when the length of the intertrial interval for a series of practice trials is the concern, the type of skill being learned is an important consideration. \par }
