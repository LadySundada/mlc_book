accuracy skills we discussed earlier, vision monitors the grasp itself to supplement tactile and proprioceptive feedback to ensure that the grasp adjusts as needed during the grasping and manipulation of the object. }

Goodale (2005) has shown that because of the different roles of central and peripheral vision, especially as they relate to the two visual systems of vision-for-perception and vision-for-action, prehension skill performance is enhanced when the person looks directly at the object.

{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-3 One final point that is important to note with regard to the motor control aspects of prehension is that it demonstrates speed-accuracy trade-off character\u173 ?

example, in an experiment by Bootsma, Marteniuk, MacKenzie, \line and Zaal (1994), movement distance and object width influenced movement time during prehension in accordance with the predictions of Fitts}
{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-3 \rquote  law. In addition, these object characteristics \u173 ?influenced the movement kinematics of the action. The relevance of the kinematic evidence is that it provides a way to explain why movement time increases as object width decreases. The kinematics showed that as objects decrease in size, the amount of time involved in the deceleration phase of the movement increases, suggesting that the increase in movement time associated with the smaller objects is due to the\u8239 ?
person reducing the speed of the limb as it approaches the object. This means that when a person reaches for a cup that has a small handle, not only will the transport and grasp kinematics differ from reaching for a cup with no handle, but the movement time will also be slower, because of the increased \u173 ?
accuracy demands of grasping the small handle.\par }\pard\plain \s12\f5\fs20\ltrpar\qj\fi240\li0\ri0\sb0\sa0\tx240\facenter\sl240\slmult0\expnd0\expndtw0\cf0\up0\charscalex100\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\accnone\hyphpar1\lang1033
{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-3 A different approach to relating prehension actions to Fitts\rquote  law was reported by Latash and Jaric (2002).

{\fs20 When we consider the act of handwriting from an anatomical perspective, we see that there is a great deal of individual variation in terms of limb segment involvement.

 That is, a person can }{\fs20 adapt to the specific demands of the writing \u173 ?context and adjust size, force, direction, and even muscle involvement to accommodate those demands. The notable outcome is that there is a great degree of similarity in characteristics such as letter forms, writing slant, relative force for stroke production, and relative timing between strokes. People have little trouble varying characteristics such as movement time and writing size, among others.\par }
{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-4 The complexity of handwriting control makes it difficult to develop a simple control model describing the components of this process. A person can write his or her signature or a familiar phrase with the preferred hand, with the nonpreferred hand, with a foot, or by holding a pen in the mouth. This suggests that at least the spatial features of writing are represented in the memory system in an abstract form. Also, this motor equivalence capability suggests the involvement of coordinative structures in handwriting control.\par }
{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-5 Another interesting feature of the act of handwrit}{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-3 ing is that several control processes occur at the same time. To write a sentence, a person must use lexical and semantic cognitive processes, as well as\u8239 ?
motor control processes. Writing requires the \u173 ?person to \u173 ?retrieve words from memory. These words must have meanings that fit what the writer intends to convey. The written sentence requires specific grammatical construction. The words \u173 ?
require a certain spelling, which involves the person}{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-3 \rquote s movement of the limb to produce specific \u173 ?
letters that are of an appropriate size and shape for what he or she is writing on. Further, the individual must hold the writing instrument with an appropriate amount of force to allow these letters to be formed. The capability of humans to carry out these various cognitive and motor \u173 ?

{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2 Motor control theories have inspired two distinct views on how people learn to uncouple their limbs.

From a dynamical systems theory perspective, the control issue is rather straightforward. The initial tendency for the arms to be spatially and temporally coupled represents an attractor state characterized by a specific relative phase relationship.

{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-3 Some researchers have reported evidence indicating that observation of the initial flight should continue until the ball reaches its zenith (Amazeen, Amazeen, Post, & Beek, 1999), although others have indicated that only the first 300 msec of flight are important (e.g., Whiting, Gill, & Stephenson, 1970). The important point here is that visual contact with the object is needed for an amount of time during its initial flight phase that is sufficient to obtain information to determine estimates of the direction and distance of the flight. }
{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-3 (See Lopez-Molinar et al., 2010, for more recent evidence to support this point.)}{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-3
\par }{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-4 In terms of visual contact with the object during its final portion of flight, research evidence indicates that the time period between 200 and 300 msec before hand contact is critical for successful catching (Savelsbergh, Whiting, Pijpers, & van Santvoord, 1993), although the precise amount of time may depend on the specific characteristics of the situation, especially the length of time the object is in flight and its velocity (see Bennett, Davids, & Craig, 1999). The need to see the ball during the final portion of its flight is to obtain specific time-to-contact information for the final spatial positioning of the hand and fingers, and the timing of the closing of the fingers during the grasp of the object.\par }
{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2 What about visual contact with the object in flight between these two time periods? Research by Elliott and his colleagues (e.g., Elliott, Zuberec, & Milgram, 1994) indicates that continuous visual contact with the ball during this period of time is }

Must a person be able to see his or her hands throughout the flight of a ball to successfully catch the ball?}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2
 In one of the first experiments investigating this question, Smyth and Marriott (1982) attached a screen to the participants so they could see the oncoming ball, but not their hands.

{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2 Interesting as the Smyth and Marriott results may be, research since their work has shown that }{\*\cs56\fs20\b0\i\expnd0\expndtw-2

We might expect this, as Davids (1988) argued, because the effective use of peripheral vision is a function of age and experience. Because we use peripheral vision to see our hands as we try to catch an oncoming object, it is logical to expect that our need to see our hands to catch a ball will depend on our age and experience.\par }
{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw2 Fischman and Schneider (1985) provided empirical evidence that supports the influence of experience. Using the same experimental procedures as those of Smyth and Marriott, they included participants who had at least five years}
{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw2 \rquote  experience in varsity baseball or softball. The results of this experiment (figure 7.5) showed that although the number of catches decreased when the experienced people could not see their hands, the type of error did not depend on whether or not the participants could see their hands. However, for the inexperienced ball catchers, more positioning errors than grasp errors occurred when they could not see their hands.\par }

{\fs20 catching a ball (see Bennett, Davids, & Craig, 1999). More-\u173 ?experienced and skilled catchers do not need to see their hands; less-experienced and low-skill catchers require vision of their hands. The reason for this difference appears to relate to a person\rquote s capability to use proprioceptive feedback to catch a moving object. The less-experienced, low-skilled person needs visual feedback to assist in the use of proprioceptive feedback to spatially position his or her arms and hands and to effectively grasp the object. In terms of helping people improve their catching skill, this relationship between experience and the need for vision of the hands suggests that beginners and less-skilled people should practice catching primarily in situations where they can see their hands throughout the ball flight, from the point where the ball leaves the thrower\rquote s hand until the ball is grasped.\par }

{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw2 The classic experiment related to the role of vision in baseball batting was performed many years ago by Hubbard and Seng (1954). Using cinematography techniques, they found that professional baseball players tracked the ball only to a point, at which time they made their swing. This point did not coincide with the point where the bat made contact with the ball. Each batter tended to synchronize the start of the step forward with the release of the ball from the pitcher\rquote s hand. And, perhaps most important, the durations of the batters\rquote  swings were remarkably consistent from swing to swing, indicating that it was the initiation of the swing that batters adjusted according to the speed of the oncoming pitch. Interestingly, these findings agree precisely with expectations from a }
{\*\cs56\fs20\b0\i\expnd0\expndtw2 tau}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw2 -based strategy for \u173 ?hitting. That is, the initiation of the batting action occurred at a critical time to contact.}

{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2 Some of the findings of Hubbard and Seng have been either verified or extended in research reported since their study. For example, thirty years later, Bahill and LaRitz (1984) used more sophisticated technology to closely monitor eye and head movements of a major league baseball player and several college baseball players. The study was done in a laboratory situation that simulated players\rquote  responses to a high-and-outside fastball thrown by a left-handed pitcher to a right-handed batter. The major league player visually tracked the ball longer than the college players did. The college players tracked the ball to a point about 9 ft in front of the plate, at which point their visual tracking began to fall behind the ball. The major league player kept up with the ball until it reached a point about 5.5 ft in front of the plate before falling behind in his tracking. Also, regardless of the pitch speed, the major league player followed the same visual tracking pattern and was very consistent in every stance he took to prepare for the pitch. While tracking the ball, his head position changed less than one degree across all pitches but he never moved \u173 ?
his\u8239 ?body.\par }{\fs20 Batting also involves perception-action coupling, as demonstrated in research by Katsumata (2008). Two timing characteristics showed this coupling. First, as other researchers have reported, the timing of the initiation of stepping with the front foot and its associated weight shift was influenced by the speed of the pitch; stepping initiation began later for slow pitches than for fast pitches. Second, the coordination of the timing of the initiation of the batter\rquote s moving his front foot forward and the initiation of swinging the bat was consistent regardless of pitch speed. Thus the temporal coupling of these events establishes a well-\line developed coordinative structure for the action of batting a pitched baseball.}

{\fs20 and Ziskind-Conhaim & Hochman, 2017,}{\fs20  for reviews of CPGs). These mechanisms provide the basis for stereotypic locomotive patterns such as walking and running.

research evidence supports a CPG-based control of human locomotion, there is also evidence that the CPG is not the sole basis for this control.

evidence that there are two arm-leg coordination patterns for walking: a 2:1 ratio (i.e., two arm swings to each leg stride) for very slow walking, and a 1:1 ratio for walking at speeds greater than 0.75 m/s (1.7 mi/hr, or 2.72 km/hr). Van Emmerik and \u173 ?
Wagenaar (1996) reported that additional research has established that the transition from the 2:1 to the 1:1 arm-leg relationship occurs within the walking speed range of 0.2 to 1.2 m/s (0.5 to 2.7 mi/hr, or 0.3 to 4.32 km/hr). In addition to the arm-leg relationship, the pelvis and thorax also demonstrate a rhythmic relationship during walking. At lower speeds, they move in phase with each other, but out of phase at higher walking speeds.\par What is the practical benefit of knowing about these various coordination characteristics of gait patterns? Van Emmerik and Wagenaar (1996) pre\u173 ?
sented an excellent argument, along with research evidence, to support their view that knowing about these characteristics and using them as assessment techniques allow us to identify coordination problems in the trunk and extremities, especially for \u173 ?
people with Parkinson\rquote s disease. For example, when\u8239 ?walking at preferred speeds, Parkinson\rquote s \u173 ?patients show pelvis and thorax phase relationships that are exactly opposite to those \u173 ?
described in the previous paragraph for healthy people.}{\fs20 \par }{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-3 Another example of the clinical use of coordination characteristics of gait patterns was presented in a study of people who recently had experienced anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) replacement surgery (Kurz, Stergiou, Buzzi, & Georgoulis, 2005). The researchers calculated the relative phase (a coordination quantification technique that was discussed in chapter 2) for the foot-shank and shank-thigh leg segments. The results showed relative phase characteristics for the ACL-reconstructed knee that differed from the normal knee. These differences led the researchers to conclude that the analysis of the relative phase dynamics of the reconstructed knee would provide clinically important information for patient performance at various stages of rehabilitation.\par }
{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-3 Another application of understanding the rhythmic coordination characteristics of gait is the use of this understanding to develop training or therapy strategies practitioners can use to help people improve their gait. For example, results from an experiment reported by Ford, Wagenaar, and Newell (2007) showed that post-stroke patients improved several aspects of their gait following treadmill training, with a metronome set at specific rhythmic frequencies (which systematically increased and decreased while the treadmill was at a constant speed), and with instructions to move their arms and legs to the beat of the metronome. The improvements included gait cadence, stride length, arm-leg swing coordination, and the phase relationship of the pelvic-thoracic rotation. (For a review of research concerning post-stroke interventions and gait control, see Hollands, Pelton, Tyson, Hollands, & van Vliet, 2012.) }

{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-4 Why is head stability so important to maintain during locomotion? The answer relates to the role the head plays. When we consider that the head contains the complex of sensory and motor ner\u8209 ?

locomotion optimizes the use of vision in actions in which vision of an object while running is essential for achieving the action goal. For example, a baseball or tennis player must visually track the flight of the ball while running in order to catch or hit it. \u173 ?
Finally, it is interesting in light of the importance of head stability during \u173 ?locomotion that researchers have found that children with cerebral palsy and adults with neurological impairment commonly adopt what could be considered \ldblquote atypical\rdblquote  \u173 ?

{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw2 Another important gait characteristic, which was briefly described in chapter 5, is the spontaneous change from a walking to a running gait (and \line vice versa) at certain speeds. Although these spontaneous gait transitions are common to all people, the speed at which transition occurs varies \u173 ?
among individuals. Some people continue to walk at higher speeds than others, whereas some people continue to run at lower speeds than others. In addition, the walk-to-run transition typically occurs at higher speeds than the run-to-walk transition.

{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1 \u8194\'20Rese\u173 ?archers have developed and tested several hypotheses to explain gait transitions (see Guerin & Bardy, 2008, for an overview of these hypotheses).

{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw1 To discuss the motor control issues associated with making contact with objects with our feet during locomotor activity, we will use the long-jump situation as an example. It is an activity that many researchers have studied, with results that apply to other types of activities. To successfully perform the long jump, the athlete needs to make contact with the take-off board at maximum running speed. This run-up portion of the long jump can be thought of as similar to an aiming task; it requires the athlete to move a certain distance and then hit a target. The target is the take-off board, which is about 20 cm long (from front to back) and 1.2 m wide (from side to side). If any part of the athlete}
{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw1 \rquote s foot extends beyond the back edge of the board (i.e., the edge nearer the landing pit), a foul is called and the jump does not count. On the other hand, if the tip of the foot strikes short of the\u8239 ?
board, the jump is that amount shorter because the\u8239 ?jump distance is measured from the back edge of the board.\par }{\*\cs56\fs20\b0\i\expnd0\expndtw2
The motor control question}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw2  related to the run-up is this: What does the athlete do during the run-up to hit the take-off board as accurately as possible? One possibility is that the athlete performs the same \u173 ?
pro\u173 ?grammed step pattern during each run-up on each jump. This would mean that any error in hitting the take-off board would be due to an error in the programmed step pattern. However, research evidence has shown that this is }
{\*\cs56\fs20\b0\i\expnd0\expndtw2 not}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw2  what the athlete does. \u173 ?Although each long jumper takes a number of steps during each run-up that is specific to him or her, the step lengths of the last few steps vary across run-ups. Most scholars now agree that the reason for this is that the athletes use visual information that specifies the amount of time it will take to contact the take-off board. The motor control system uses this }
{\*\cs56\fs20\b0\i\expnd0\expndtw2 time-to-contact}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw2  information, which is specified by the visual variable }
{\*\cs56\fs20\b0\i\expnd0\expndtw2 tau}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw2  (}{\fs20\expnd1\expndtw4\u964 ?}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw2 ), to make stride-length adjustments during the last few steps to correct for the targeting error that has accumulated during the run-up. Without these adjustments, the athlete would \u173 ?
either be short or long of the take-\line off board.\par }{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-3 In what has become a classic experiment demonstrating this time-to-contact influence for a locomotor}
{\fs20  skill requiring object contact, Lee, Lishman, and Thomson (1982) filmed three highly skilled female long jumpers during their approaches to the take-off board. By analyzing stride-length changes as each athlete approached and contacted the \u173 ?
take-off board for a series of six long jumps, the researchers observed several \u173 ?important gait pattern characteristics. We will \u173 ?
examine these using the results from one of these \u173 ?athletes (an Olympic-level performer), presented in figure 7.7.}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw1
\par }{\fs20 Initially, the athlete\rquote s stride length increased at a }{\fs20 relatively constant rate for the first five to six strides; it then became similar for the next six strides. These strides were relatively consistent across the six jumps. Then, }
{\*\cs56\fs20\b0\i\expnd0\expndtw0 on the final six strides,}{\fs20  something different occurred. The athlete made stride-length adjustments so that she could hit the board accurately. In fact, she made almost 50 percent of these adjustments on the last stride. The lower half of the figure shows why she had to make these adjustments. As the athlete ran down the track, small inconsistencies in each stride had a cumu\u173 ?
lative effect, so that when she was five strides from the board the error had risen to 37 cm. If she had not adjusted her stride lengths on the remaining strides, she would have missed hitting the take-off board by a long distance.\par }
{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1 These stride-length characteristics led the \u173 ?authors to describe the long jump run-up as consisting of two\u8239 ?
phases: an }{\*\cs56\fs20\b0\i\expnd0\expndtw-1 initial accelerative phase,}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1  where an athlete produces stereotypic stride patterns, followed by a }
{\*\cs56\fs20\b0\i\expnd0\expndtw-1 zeroing-in phase,}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1  where the athlete modifies stride patterns to eliminate accumulated error. They concluded that a long jumper bases the correction process during the second phase on visual information obtained }
{\*\cs56\fs20\b0\i\expnd0\expndtw-1 in advance of}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1  these strides. This means that the \u173 ?visual system picks up time-to-contact information from the board and directs the locomotor control system to make appropriate stride-length modifications for the strides remaining until contact with the take-off board.}
{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1 \par }{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-5 It is worth noting that the use of visual time-to-\u173 ?contact information to regulate gait does}
{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-4  not \u173 ?depend on the expertise of the person. Although the participants in the Lee and authors long jump study were\u8239 ?
highly skilled, novice long jumpers also have demonstrated similar stride-length adjustments consistent with the influence of }{\*\cs56\fs20\b0\i\expnd-1\expndtw-5
tau}{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-4  (Berg, Wade, &\u8239 ?Greer, 1994).}{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-4 \par }{\fs20 In the second phase of the run-up, the percentage of the total stride-length corrections made on each stride can be used as a way to demonstrate the }
{\*\cs56\fs20\b0\i\expnd0\expndtw0 perception-action coupling}{\fs20  involved in the long jump run-up. If }{\*\cs56\fs20\b0\i\expnd0\expndtw0
tau}{\fs20  is the visual variable that influences the long jumper\rquote s performance during this phase of the run-up, we would expect to see \u173 ?
evidence of a coupling between the visually detected time-to-contact and movement corrections. This coupling would be best demonstrated by a linear relationship between the percentage of the total adjustment and the number of strides remaining to hit the take-off board. Montagne \line et al. (2000) presented evidence of this relationship in a study involving long jumpers of various levels of expertise. As you can see in }
{\fs20 figure\u8239 ?7.8, the per\u173 ?centage of the total amount of adjustment increased linearly for the final five strides from the take-off board. And, similar to what Lee, Lishman, and Thomson (1982) found for elite jumpers, approximately 40\u8239 ?
per\u173 ?cent of the total amount \u173 ?of\u8239 ?adjustment occurred on the stride before the \u173 ?take-off board.}{\fs20 \par Researchers have found that other types of gait also involve adjustments during locomotion on the basis of visual time-to-contact information. Some examples are walking a given distance and stepping on the target with a specified foot (Laurent \line & Thomson, 1988); running and stepping on targets, as people do when crossing a creek on rocks \u173 ?
(Warren, Young, & Lee, 1986); doing run-ups to the\u8239 ?springboard and horse while performing the vault in women\rquote s gymnastics (Meeuwsen }

{\*\cs56\fs20\b0\i Bimanual coordination skills}{\fs20  require the simul\u173 ?taneous performance of the two arms. Some tasks\u8239 ?
require symmetric bimanual coordination (i.e.,\u8239 ?both arms perform in the same way at the same time); others require asymmetric bimanual \u173 ?
coordination (i.e., each arm performs differently). An important motor control characteristic of these skills is the natural, or intrinsic, spatial and temporal coupling of the arms, which means that we have a preference to move the arms symmetrically. Personal experience and research evidence shows that people can learn to uncouple the arms to perform asymmetric bimanual coordination skills. At the present time, researchers have not determined the specific motor control mechanism that underlies the control of arms in this \u173 ?

{\fs18\expnd0\expndtw0 Researchers have not agreed on a motor control explanation for the speed-accuracy trade-off. Below is a sampling of some of the prominent hypotheses that continue to have proponents. It is important to understand that these hypotheses relate to explanations for the speed-accuracy trade-off associated with rapid manual-aiming tasks, which were the types of tasks involved in the initial demonstrations of the trade-off. (See Elliott et al., \line }
{\fs18\expnd0\expndtw-2 2001, for a more detailed discussion of these, and other, hypotheses and of the research evidence related to them.)\par }

{\f4\fs18\b\i0\expnd0\expndtw-2 Intermittent feedback hypothesis.}{\fs18\expnd0\expndtw-2  Crossman and Goodeve (1983) proposed that open-loop control is involved in the initiation of a rapid manual aiming task. But as the arm moves toward the target, the person intermittently uses feedback to generate submovements, which are small corrections in the trajectory, until the target is contacted. Movement time (MT) increases for longer distances or narrower targets because the number of corrections increases. For a reciprocal aiming task, some of the MT increase occurs because the person spends more time in contact with each target to evaluate visual feedback and plan the movement to the next target.\par }
{\f4\fs18\b\i0 Impulse-timing hypothesis.}{\fs18  Schmidt and colleagues (1979) proposed that many speed-accuracy tasks involve movements that are too fast to allow for the use of visual feedback to make corrections during the movement. In these situations, they hypothesized that a person programs commands in advance of movement initiation. These commands are forwarded to the muscles as \ldblquote impulses,\rdblquote  which are the forces produced during a specific amount of time. The result is that the arm is forcefully driven toward the target and achieves accuracy based on the specified amount of force and time. Because amounts of force and time relate to movement variability, increases in movement velocity result in more variable movement. To correct an inaccurate outcome, the person would need to slow arm speed on the next attempt.}
{\fs18 \par }{\f4\fs18\b\i0\expnd0\expndtw-1 Multiple submovements hypothesis.}{\fs18\expnd0\expndtw-1  Meyer and colleagues (1988, 1990) adopted elements of both the intermittent-feedback and impulse-timing \u173 ?
hypotheses. They proposed that before initiating movement, the person programs an initial impulse, which is then executed. If the movement is accurate, nothing further is required. But if feedback during the movement indicates that the movement will be inaccurate, the person prepares and executes submovements that adjust the initial velocity. This process continues until the person produces an accurate movement. The number of submovements made relates to movement time and the target distance and width (see also Yao & Fischman, 1999).\par }

of this treatment has come from patients with stroke, although more recent applications have been reported for children with cerebral palsy (CP) (see Gordon, Charles, & Wolf, 2005, for a brief review of this research).}

Instead of target size and distance, the accuracy characteristic of most tasks researchers have used to investigate Fitts\rquote  law, they considered the accuracy component of the task to be the transporting of the mug from a tabletop to the mouth without spilling its contents. Their logic was that a mug that is full to its rim requires more movement accuracy and is therefore a more difficult task than a mug that is less full.

{\fs18\expnd0\expndtw1 An experiment by Steenbergen, Marteniuk, and Kalbfleisch (1995) provides a good illustration of how adaptable the motor control system is. We see this adaptability when people alter movements of a specific action to accommodate characteristics of the task situation. The authors asked the participants to reach and grasp with the right or left hand a \u173 ?
\line Styrofoam cup that was either full or empty. Participants had to grasp the cup, located 30 cm in front of them, then place it on a round target 20 cm to the right or left. Movement analyses of the hand transport and grasp phases revealed interesting differences at the movement level depending on which hand a person used and whether the cup was full or empty. \line For \u173 ?
example, during the transport phase, hand velocity was distinctly faster and peak velocity was earlier when the cup was empty. The grasp aperture time also varied according to the cup characteristic. Maximum grasp aperture occurred earlier in the transport phase for the full cup, a situation demanding more movement precision. In terms of coordination of the joints involved in the action, participants froze the degrees of freedom of the shoulder, elbow, and wrist joints during the prehension movements for both full and empty cups. However, when the cup was full, participants increased stabilization during the movement by making a trunk postural adjustment that moved the shoulder forward.\par }

{\fs18 & LaRitz, 1984) indicates that batters probably never see the bat hit the ball. If they do, it is because they have jumped in their visual focus from some point in the ball flight to the bat contact point.

Batters commonly track the ball to a certain point and then visually jump to a point where they predict the ball will be at bat contact.\par }

{\fs18 One of the primary movement disorders common to people who have Parkinson\rquote s disease is slowness of gait (i.e., gait hypokinesia). Two questions have interested researchers and physical therapists concerning this gait problem. One, what movement characteristic accounts for the slowness? Two possibilities are \u173 ?
cadence, which would mean that the difficulty relates to the rhythm, or beat, of the walking pace, and stride length, which would mean that the slowness is due to strides that are shorter than normal. The answer to this question is important for the second question: Is there a rehabilitation strategy that would help patients improve their control of walking gait speed?\par }

{\fs18\expnd0\expndtw-2 Evidence that the improvement in these gait characteristics can be long-lasting was provided in a case study reported by Sidaway, Anderson, Danielson, Martin, and Smith (2006). The Parkinson\rquote s patient walked during a four-week training period with visual cues on the floor that were similar to those used in the Morris et al. (1994) experiment. At the end of the training period, the patient\rquote s stride length and gait speed improved. What was especially impressive, however, was that these improvements were maintained without the use of the visual cues one month after the training ended. }
{\fs18\expnd0\expndtw-2 More recent evidence of the visual-cueing benefit was presented by Vitorio et al. (2014). Also, for an extensive review of research on this issue, which showed a large amount of evidence to support the visual-cueing benefit, see Rocha et al. (2014).}
{\fs18\expnd0\expndtw-2 \par }{\fs18\expnd-1\expndtw-4 In light of these results for visual cues, it is interesting to note that several researchers (e.g., Baker, Rochester, & Nieuwboer, 2007; McIntosh, Brown, Rice, & Thaut, 1997}
{\fs18\expnd-1\expndtw-4 ; see also a research literature review and meta-analysis by Ghai et al., 2018}{\fs18\expnd-1\expndtw-4
