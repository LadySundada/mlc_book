{\fs18 When people perform a motor skill, they can have avail\u173 ?able to them }{\*\cs53\f3\fs18\b0\i two general types of performance-\u173 ?

One is }{\*\cs54\fs18\b\i0\expnd0\expndtw-1 task-\u173 ?intrinsic feedback,}{\fs18  which is the sensory-\line perceptual information that is a natural part of performing a skill. Each of our sensory systems can provide this type of feedback. We discussed three of these in chapter 6: touch, proprioception, and vision. For example, if a person throws a dart at a target on the wall, he or she receives }
{\*\cs53\f3\fs18\b0\i visual }{\fs18 task-intrinsic feedback from seeing the flight of the dart and where it lands on the target. In addition, the person receives }
{\*\cs53\f3\fs18\b0\i tactile and}{\fs18  }{\*\cs53\f3\fs18\b0\i proprio\u173 ?ceptive}{\fs18  task-\u173 ?intrinsic feedback from the head, trunk, and limbs as he or she prepares and executes the throw. Other sensory systems can also provide task-intrinsic feedback, as does the }
{\*\cs53\f3\fs18\b0\i auditory}{\fs18  system when the person hears the dart hit, or not hit, the target.\par }\pard\plain \s9\f1\fs18\ltrpar\qj\fi240\li0\ri0\sb0\sa0\tx240\facenter\sl240\slmult0\expnd0\expndtw0\cf1\up0\charscalex100\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\accnone\hyphpar1\lang1033
{\fs18\expnd0\expndtw2 The second general type of performance-related information is }{\*\cs53\f3\fs18\b0\i\expnd0\expndtw2 in addition to}
{\fs18\expnd0\expndtw2  task-intrinsic feedback. }{\fs18\expnd0\expndtw1 Although various terms have been used to identify this }
{\fs18\expnd0\expndtw2 type of feedback (}{\*\cs53\f3\fs18\b0\i\expnd0\expndtw2 e.g., external feedback, task-\u173 ?extrinsic feedback}
{\fs18\expnd0\expndtw2 ), the term that will be used in this book is }{\*\cs54\fs18\b\i0\expnd0\expndtw2 augmented feedback.}{\fs18\expnd0\expndtw2
 The adjective \line \ldblquote augmented\rdblquote  refers to adding to or enhancing something, which in this case involves }{\*\cs53\f3\fs18\b0\i\expnd0\expndtw2

{\*\cs53\f3\fs18\b0\i\expnd0\expndtw2 enhances}{\fs18\expnd0\expndtw2  the task-intrinsic feedback that provides information the person\rquote s sensory system could readily detect on its own, though not necessarily reliably. For example, a teacher or coach might tell a golfer where his or her hands were positioned at the top of the swing, even though proprioceptive feedback would allow the person to feel for himself or herself where they were. In a clinical environment, a therapist might show an amputee \u173 ?\u173 ?\u173 ?

{\fs18\expnd0\expndtw1 In other situations, augmented feedback }{\*\cs53\f3\fs18\b0\i\expnd0\expndtw1 adds}{\fs18\expnd0\expndtw1
 information that the person cannot detect using his or her sensory system. For example, the golf teacher or coach might tell the golfer where the ball landed because the\u8239 ?
golfer was concentrating so much on keeping his or\u8239 ?her head down during the swing that he or she did not see it after it was hit. Likewise, a therapist might tell\u8239 ?
a patient how much his or her body swayed \u173 ?because vestibular problems prevent the \u173 ?patient from being able to detect this information. In each of these situations, augmented feedback provides performance information that otherwise would not be available to the person.}

{\fs20 The category of augmented feedback known as }{\f6\fs20\b\i0 knowledge of results}{\fs20  (commonly referred to as }{\f6\fs20\b\i0
KR}{\fs20 ) consists of }{\*\cs55\fs20\b0\i externally presented information about the outcome }{\*\cs55\fs20\b0\i (result) }{\*\cs55\fs20\b0\i
of an attempt to perform a skill.}{\fs20  For example, if a teacher tells a student in an archery class, \ldblquote The shot was in the blue }
{\fs20 \line }{\fs20 at 9 o}{\fs20 \rquote clock,\rdblquote  the teacher is providing performance outcome information. Similarly, a therapist may provide a patient with a computer-generated graph indicating how close he came to achieving a target range of motion during hip internal rotation.\par }
\pard\plain \s15\f7\fs20\ltrpar\qj\fi240\li0\ri0\sb0\sa0\tx240\facenter\sl240\slmult0\expnd0\expndtw0\cf1\up0\charscalex100\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\accnone\hyphpar1\lang1033
{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw0 Sometimes, KR simply tells the performer }{\*\cs55\fs20\b0\i\expnd0\expndtw0 whether he or she has achieved the performance goal. }
{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw0 This is the case when some external device gives a \ldblquote yes\rdblquote  or }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw0 \ldblquote no\rdblquote  signal indicating whether or not the performance goal was achieved. For example, to augment proprioceptive and visual feedback for a patient working on achieving a specific amount of knee extension, the therapist could set a buzzer to be activated when the patient achieved the goal number of degrees of movement. Although the buzzer would provide no information about how close to the goal the movement was if it had not been achieved, the patient would know that he or she had not achieved the goal unless the buzzer sounded. There are some additional examples of KR in table 15.1.\par }
{\fs20 It is important to point out that we are using the term }{\*\cs55\fs20\b0\i KR}{\fs20  to refer to one type of augmented feedback. Although a person can obtain knowledge about the results of an action from his or her own sensory system, such as seeing whether the basketball mis\u173 ?

{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw1 In addition to giving KP verbally, there are \line various nonverbal means of providing KP. For example, }

{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw1  the correct movement. Another example of nonverbal KP is video}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw1  replay}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw1
, which}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw1  }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw1 is a popular method of showing a person what he or she did while performing a skill. Video replay allows the person to see what he or \u173 ?
she actually did that led to the outcome of that perfor\u173 ?mance. Although video replay can show a \u173 ?performance outcome, it is commonly used as KP. Another means of providing KP that is increasing in popularity as computer software becomes more accessible is showing the person \u173 ?
computer-generated kinematic characteristics of the just-completed \u173 ?per\u173 ?formance. In clinical environments, therapists also use biofeedback devices to give KP. For example, a therapist can attach a buzzer to an EMG recording device so that the person hears the buzzer sound when he or she activates the appropriate muscle during the performance of an action. In each of these situations, sensory feedback is augmented in a way that informs the person about the movement characteristics associated with the outcome of an action.}

{\fs20 In some skill learning situations, people, for various reasons, cannot use the task-intrinsic feedback to determine what they need to do to improve \u173 ?

{\*\cs55\fs20\b0\i First,}{\fs20  }{\*\cs55\fs20\b0\i some skill performance contexts do not make critical sensory feedback available to the \u173 ?
person}{\fs20 . For example, when a performer cannot see a target that he or she must hit, the performer does not have important visual feedback available. In this case, augmented feedback provides critical information that is not available from the task perfor\u173 ?

{\fs20 Some motor skills }{\*\cs55\fs20\b0\i inherently provide sufficient task-intrinsic feedback,}{\fs20  so augmented feedback is redundant. For these types of skills, learners can use their own sensory feedback systems to determine the \u173 ?\u173 ?\u173 ?
ap\u173 ?p\u173 ?ropriateness of their movements and make adjustments on future attempts. An experiment by Magill, Chamberlin, and Hall (1991) provides a labora\u173 ?
tory example of this type of situation. Participants learned a coincidence-anticipation skill in which they simulated striking a moving object, which was a series of LEDs sequentially lighting along a 281 cm long trackway. As they faced the trackway, they had to use a handheld bat to knock down a small wooden barrier directly under a target LED coincident with the lighting of the target. KR was the number of msec that they contacted the \u173 ?
barrier before or after the target lighted. Four experiments showed that participants learned this task regardless of the number of trials on which they received KR during practice. In fact, receiving KR during practice did not lead to better learning than practice without KR. }
{\fs20 It is important to note that these results were replicated in an experiment reported by Coker (2006).}{\fs20 \par }\pard\plain \s15\f7\fs20\ltrpar\qj\fi240\li0\ri0\sb0\sa0\tx240\facenter\sl240\slmult0\expnd0\expndtw0\cf1\up0\charscalex100\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\accnone\hyphpar1\lang1033
{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2 A motor skill that does not require augmented feedback to learn it has an important characteristic: }{\*\cs55\fs20\b0\i\expnd0\expndtw-2
a detectable external referent }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2 in the environment that the person can use to determine the \u173 ?appropriateness of an action. For the anticipation timing task in the Magill et al. experiment, the target and other LEDs were the external referents. The learner could see when the bat made contact with the barrier in comparison to when the target LED lighted; this enabled him or her to see the relationship between his or her own movements and the goal of those movements. It is important to note here that the learner may }
{\*\cs55\fs20\b0\i\expnd0\expndtw-2 not}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2  be consciously aware of this relationship. The sensory system and the \u173 ?
motor control system operate in these situations in a\u8239 ?way that does not demand the person\rquote s conscious awareness of the environmental characteristics (see Magill, 1998). Thus, the enhancement of these characteristics by providing augmented feedback does not increase or speed up learning of the skill.\par }
{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2 Practice condition characteristics also influence the need for augmented feedback. One of these characteristics is the existence of an observational learning situation, which we discussed in chap\u173 ?
ter\u8239 ?14. Two different types of observational learning \u173 ?situations can be influential. In one, the learner \u173 ?ob\u173 ?
serves a skilled model perform the skill. For \u173 ?example, in an experiment by Magill and Schoenfelder-Zohdi \line }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1
(1996), people who observed a skilled demonstra\u173 ?tion }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2 learned a rhythmic gymnastics rope skill as well as those who received verbal KP after each trial. In the other situation, the learner observes other \u173 ?
beginners practice. For example, Hebert and Landin (1994) showed that beginning tennis players who watched other beginners practice learned the tennis forehand volley as well as or better than beginning players who received verbal KP. In both of these situations, beginners were able to practice and improve without augmented feedback. }
{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2 It is interesting to note that similar effects were found by Xeroulis and colleagues (2007) for medical students learning suturing and knot-tying skills for surgery.}
{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2 \par }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw1 There is an interesting parallel between skill learning situations in which learners do not need augmented feedback and results of studies investi\u173 ?
gating the use of teacher feedback in physical education class settings. These studies consistently have shown low correlations for the relationship between teacher feedback and student achievement (e.g., Lee, Keh, & Magill, 1993; Silverman, Tyson, & Krampitz, 1991). This finding suggests that the amount and quality of teacher feedback is influential for improving the skills of beginners in sport skills class \u173 ?
settings, but we should not see it as the most important variable. Other variables, such as opportunities for observational learning or the clarity of task-intrinsic feedback, appear to be capable of precluding the need for augmented feedback.

However, improvement seems to stop at a certain level of performance usually because the learner\rquote s lack of experience results in his or her decreased capability to discriminate small movement-speed differences.

{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-4 \par }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2 Another type of skill for which augmented feedback enhances learning is any complex skill that \u173 ?
requires a person to acquire an appropriate multi\u173 ?limb pattern of coordination. For such skills, learners can attain a certain degree of success simply by making repeated attempts to achieve the perfor\u173 ?
mance goal. But this goal achievement process can be speeded up with the addition of KP. More specifically, the KP that works best is information about critical components of the coordination pattern.\par }
{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw1 The best research example of this type of skill is\u8239 ?an experiment by Wallace and Hagler (1979). Participants learned a one-hand basketball set shot with the nondominant hand, from a distance of 3.03\u8239 ?

depends on the goal of the information. Error-related information works better to facilitate skill acquisition, whereas information about correct performance serves better to motivate the person to continue.

{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2 Most of the evidence addressing the first question comes from the study of physical education teachers in actual class situations. The best example is a study by Fishman and Tobey (1978). Although their study was conducted many years ago, it is \u173 ?
representative of more recent studies, and it involves the most extensive sampling of teachers and classes of any study that has investigated this question. Fishman and Tobey observed teachers in eighty-one classes teaching a variety of physical \u173 ?

{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2 difficult to provide because of the lack of sufficient and conclusive evidence from research investigating this question. The following examples of experiments provide some insight into a reasonable answer.\par }
{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2 Two of the experiments suggest that KP is better than KR to facilitate motor skill learning. Kernodle and Carlton (1992) compared KR with videotape \u173 ?

either before hitting or in hitting the ball. KR referred to the outcome of the hit in terms of\'cathe ball\rquote s spatial precision, rotation, and flight. The results indicated that KP was more influential for learning the serve.}
{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2 \par }{\fs20 However, a study by Silverman, Woods, and \u173 ?Subramaniam (1999) provided evidence for the benefit of both KR and KP in terms of how each related to how often students in physical education classes would engage in successful and unsuccessful practice trials during a class. They observed eight middle school teachers teaching two classes each in various sport-related activities. The results indicated that teacher feedback as KR and as KP showed relatively high correlations with the frequency of students engaging in successful practice trials (.64 and .67, respectively).\par }
{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1 These studies indicate that }{\*\cs55\fs20\b0\i\expnd0\expndtw-1 both KR and KP can be valuable}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1

{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-4 \par }{\fs20 It is important to note here that the discussion of KR and KP suggests that performance errors are part of learning motor skills.

tinguish these types of information in perfor\u173 ?mance }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1 situations. For example, a therapist helping a patient to increase gait speed could give that patient qualitative information about the latest attempt in statements such as these: \ldblquote That was faster than the last time\rdblquote ; \ldblquote That was much better\rdblquote ; or }
{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1 \ldblquote You need to bend your knee more.\rdblquote  A physical education teacher teaching a student a tennis serve could tell the student that a particular serve was \ldblquote good,\rdblquote  or \ldblquote long,\rdblquote  or could say something like this: \ldblquote You made contact with the ball too far in front of you.}
{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1 \rdblquote  On the other hand, the therapist could give the patient quantitative verbal augmented feedback using these words: \ldblquote That time you walked 3 seconds faster than the last time,\rdblquote  or, \ldblquote You need to bend your knee 5 more degrees.\rdblquote  The teacher could give quantitative feedback to the tennis student like this: \ldblquote The serve was 6 centimeters too long,\rdblquote  or }
{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1 \ldblquote You made contact with the ball 10 centimeters too far in front of you.\rdblquote \par }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1
Practitioners also can give quantitative and qualitative information in }{\*\cs55\fs20\b0\i\expnd0\expndtw-2 nonverbal forms of \u173 ?
augmented feedback}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1 . For example, the therapist could give qualitative information to the patient we have described by letting him or her hear a tone when the walking speed exceeded that of the previous attempt or when the knee flexion achieved a target amount. The teacher could give the tennis student qualitative information in the form of a computer display that used a moving stick figure to show \u173 ?
the\u8239 ?kinematic characteristics of his or her serving motion. Those teaching motor skills often give \u173 ?nonverbally presented quantitative information in combination with qualitative forms. For example, the therapist could show a patient a computer-based graphic representation of his or her leg movement while walking along, displaying numerical values of the walking speeds associated with each attempt or the degree of knee flexion observed on each \u173 ?
attempt. We could describe similar examples for the tennis student.}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1 \par }{\fs20 How do these two types of augmented feedback information influence skill learning? Although the traditional view is that quantitative augmented feedback is preferred, results from an experiment by Magill and Wood (1986) suggest a different \u173 ?
conclusion. Each participant practiced moving his or her arm through a series of wooden barriers to produce a specific six-segment movement pattern. Each segment had its own criterion movement time, which participants had to learn. Performance for the first sixty trials showed no difference between qualitative and quantitative forms of KR. However,}
{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1  during the final sixty trials and on the twenty no-KR}{\fs20  retention trials, quantitative KR resulted in better performance than qualitative.\par }
{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2 These results suggest that people in the early stage of learning give attention primarily to the qualitative information, even when they have quantitative information available. The advantage of this attention focus is that the qualitative information provides an easier way to make a first approximation of the required movement. Put another way, this information allows learners to perform an action that is \ldblquote in the ballpark\rdblquote  of what they need to do, which, as we discussed in chapter 12, is an important goal for the first stage of learning. After they achieve this }
{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2 \ldblquote ballpark\rdblquote  capability, quantitative information becomes more valuable to them, because it enables them to refine characteristics of performing the skill that lead to more consistent and efficient achievement of the action goal. It is important to keep in mind that there are limits to learners\rquote  abilities to use quantitative feedback to change their movement patterns. Giblin, Farrow, Reid, Ball, and Abernethy (2015) recently showed that skilled junior tennis players could only execute a limited number of feedback-based instructions to improve their service action. The players\rquote  ability to implement more precise instructions was apparently limited by their kinesthetic sensitivity.\par }

{\fs20 Research supports the effectiveness of the performance bandwidth approach. For example, in the first reported experiment investigating this procedure, Sherwood (1988) had participants practice a rapid elbow-flexion task with a movement-time goal of 200 msec. One group received KR about their movement-time error after every trial, regardless of the amount of error (i.e., 0 percent \u173 ?
bandwidth). Two other groups received KR only when their error exceeded bandwidths of 5 percent and \line 10 percent of the goal movement time. The results of a no-KR retention test showed that the 10 percent \line bandwidth condition resulted in the least amount of movement time variability (i.e., variable error), whereas the 0 percent condition resulted in the most variable error. Other researchers have replicated and extended these results (e.g., Cauraugh, Chen, & Radlo, 1993; Coca-Ugrinowitsch et al., 2014; Lee, White, }
{\fs20 & Carnahan, 1990).\par }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1 A practical issue concerning the use of the bandwidth technique relates to the instructions provided about the bandwidth procedure. This issue is relevant because when the learners receive no augmented feedback about their performance, the implicit message is that it was \ldblquote correct.\rdblquote  There is an instruction-related question here: Is it important that the learner explicitly be told this information, or will the learner implicitly learn this information during practice? According to the results of an \u173 ?
experiment by Butler, Reeve, and Fischman (1996), the bandwidth technique leads to better learning when the participants know in advance that not \u173 ?
receiving KR means they are essentially \ldblquote correct.\rdblquote }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1 \par }\pard\plain \s14\f6\fs20\ltrpar\ql\fi0\li0\ri0\sb240\sa0\facenter\sl240\slmult0\expnd0\expndtw0\cf1\up0\charscalex100\b\i0\ul0\strike0\accnone\hyphpar0\lang1033

{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2 One of the ways augmented feedback hinders learning is by providing people with erroneous information.

In this skill learning situation, augmented feedback is redundant with the information available from task-intrinsic feedback. As a result, most people would expect that to provide augmented feedback would be a waste of time because it would not influence the learner. But research evidence shows that this is not the case, because even when augmented feedback is redundant information, beginners will use it rather than ignore it.}

{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2 The first evidence of this type of effect was reported by Buekers, Magill, and Hall (1992). Participants practiced an anticipation timing task similar to the one used by Magill, Chamberlin, and Hall (1991), which was described earlier in this chapter as a task for which KR is not needed to learn the task. In the Buekers et al. experiment, three of four groups received KR after every trial. The KR was displayed on a computer monitor and indicated to the participants }
{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2 \line }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2 the direction and amount of their timing error. For one of these groups, KR was \u173 ?
always correct. But for another group, KR was \u173 ?always erroneous by indicating that performance on a trial was 100 msec later than it actually was. The third KR group received correct KR for the first fifty trials, but then received the erroneous KR for the last twenty-five trials. }

{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2\u173 ?}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2 participants to learn to perform according to the KR rather than according to the task-intrinsic feedback. This latter result suggested that the }

began to perform similarly }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2 \line }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2 to the group that had \u173 ?received the incorrect KR for all the practice trials. In addition, the erroneous information not only \u173 ?
influenced performance when it was available but also influenced retention performance one day and one week later }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2
when no KR was available}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2 . A subsequent experiment (McNevin, Magill, & Buekers, 1994) demonstrated that the erroneous KR also influenced performance on a no-KR transfer test in which participants were required to respond to a faster or slower speed than they practiced.\par }

{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2 The preceding demonstrations of erroneous KR effects were based on laboratory tasks, but similar results have been shown for sports skills. For example, an experiment by Ford, Hodges, and Williams (2007) had skilled soccer players kicking a ball to a target, which required that the ball achieve a \u173 ?
specific height during its flight. One group of \u173 ?players received erroneous KR about the height of the ball\rquote s flight during each kick by observing a prerecorded video clip of a kicked ball that reached a height that was different from their own. Results showed that the players eventually based the height of their kicks on the erroneous video feedback rather than on their own sensory feedback. Erroneous augmented feedback has also been used in clinical settings to treat people with chronic pain conditions that are thought to result from distorted representations of the painful body part. For example, presenting osteoarthritis patients with resized images of their arthritic body part has been shown to change the patients\rquote  distorted perception of the size of the body part and reduce their pain (e.g., Gilpin, Moseley, Stanton, & Newport, 2015}

{\*\cs55\fs20\b0\i\expnd0\expndtw-1 Why would erroneous KR affect learning a skill for which KR is redundant information?}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1

{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-4 The type of augmented feedback we call \ldblquote manual feedback\rdblquote  has been referred to by various terms in the motor learning research literature. Other terms have included \ldblquote haptic\rdblquote  feedback, \ldblquote kinesthetic\rdblquote  feedback, and \ldblquote tactile\rdblquote  feedback. Each suggests a nonverbal presentation of augmented feedback. This type of augmented feedback can take various forms. Some examples include the following: A gymnastics or dance teacher moves a gymnast\rquote s or dancer\rquote s arms through a preferred trajectory after the gymnast or dancer performs a specific skill; a golf instructor moves the hands of a beginning golfer to a desired grip on the club after the golfer grips the club; and a physical therapist moves the legs of a patient as the patient attempts to walk on a slow-moving treadmill. Each of these examples demonstrates the variety of skill learning situations in which motor skill practitioners use manual guidance as augmented feedback. The important question researchers have asked is this: Does the use of manual guidance in situations like these benefit the learning of a motor skill?\par }
\pard\plain \s15\f7\fs20\ltrpar\qj\fi240\li0\ri0\sb0\sa0\tx240\facenter\sl240\slmult0\expnd0\expndtw0\cf1\up0\charscalex100\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\accnone\hyphpar1\lang1033
{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2 The amount of published research addressing this question is limited, but we will consider some examples here to summarize a general answer. Two studies reported manual guidance augmented feedback having a positive effect on improving gymnastics skills (Jeraj & Heinen, 2015; Rohleder & Vogt, 2018). In both studies, the manual guidance took the form of coaches\rquote  hand placements on the gymnasts as they performed the skills. In an experiment involving nonrowers learning a simulated rowing task, Sigrist, Rauter, Riener, and Wolf (2013) compared manual guidance (which the authors referred to as \ldblquote haptic\rdblquote  feedback) with several other types of augmented feedback (visual and auditory) presented concurrently and terminally to the participants as they performed the rowing task. The augmented feedback was used to enhance the learning of different aspects of the task, such as a robotic device that pulled the oar blade to the target trajectory when error was detected, and a vibrator on a forearm to indicate blade orientation error. Results showed that the augmented feedback produced the best learning, as assessed by a retention test, when the several types of augmented feedback were used in combination rather than alone. Finally, a study by Zhong and Stone (2013) found that manual guidance produced by a complex machine created specifically for the experiment, produced better welding skills compared to a condition in which participants did not use the training machine. \par }
{\fs20 The small amount of research literature available on this topic suggests that manual guidance feedback can effectively facilitate the learning of various types of motor skills, including sports and industrial skills. In particular, it appears that when manual guidance is effective as augmented feedback it relates to specific movement features of a skill. These appear to include limb, body, or head positioning, and movement trajectory. Perhaps more important is one of the potential problems the use of manual guidance as augmented feedback can create. Authors in the studies described in the previous paragraph expressed concern that manual guidance as augmented feedback can develop a dependence on the feedback by the learner. As you studied in earlier chapters about theories and stages of learning, the consistent view promoted was that active, movement-problem-solving practice leads to better learning than passive, movement-guided practice. Together with the studies discussed here, the important point to emphasize about the use of manual guidance as augmented feedback is that it can be useful when implemented in a way that encourages learners to actively perform movements and not become dependent on errors being passively corrected. We will discuss later in this chapter concerns about dependency on augmented feedback and some practice strategies that can help overcome its negative influence on learning skills.}

{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1 ,}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1  2002). Three groups engaged in 90 min training sessions on each of four days: a control group, which the researchers called the \ldblquote self-guided\rdblquote  group, practiced without any KP but could hit as many golf balls as they wanted; a verbal KP group received feedback from a PGA teaching professional throughout each session. The video KP group saw video replays of their swings throughout the sessions as well as getting the verbal KP from the teaching professional. The goal was to hit golf balls with a 7-iron as far as possible along a straight line. Performance was assessed by several distance and accuracy measures. Figure 15.4 shows the \u173 ?

An interesting characteristic of this study demonstrates the importance of augmented feedback in relation to the amount of practice given to the learner. Because the golfers were not limited to hitting a specified number of balls during each training session, the three groups differed in the number of balls hit during training. Surprisingly, the control group hit the most practice balls, but performed worse than the other two groups. The video KP group hit the fewest practice balls but learned the skill better than the other two groups.\par }
{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2 Research evidence also establishes that video replays }{\*\cs55\fs20\b0\i\expnd0\expndtw-2 transmit certain types of performance-related information more effectively than other types.}
{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2  One of the best examples of an experiment that supports this conclusion was one conducted many years ago by Selder and Del Rolan (1979). They compared videotape replays and verbal augmented feedback (in the form of KP) in a study in which twelve-to-thirteen-year-old girls were learning to perform a balance beam routine. All the girls used a checklist to critically analyze their own perfor\u173 ?
mance after each trial. One group used verbal KP to complete the checklist; another group completed the checklist after viewing videotape replays of each trial. At the end of six weeks of practice, the videotape group scored significantly higher on the routine than the verbal KP group. More important, when each factor of the total routine score was evaluated, the videotape group scored significantly higher on only four of the eight factors: precision, execution, amplitude, and orientation and direction. The two groups did not differ on the other four: rhythm, elegance, coordination, and lightness of jumping and tumbling.}
{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2 \par }{\fs20 The results of this study suggest that video replay facilitates the learning of those performance features that performers can readily observe and determine how to correct on the basis of what they see on the video replay.

{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2 With the widespread availability of sophisticated technology for measuring, recording, and displaying human movement, the presentation of kinematic and kinetic information as augmented feedback has become increasingly common. Magill and Anderson \line (2012) have highlighted a range of different ways in which feedback on kinematic and kinetic parameters has been used to facilitate the learning of sports skills. However, the use of such feedback has been equally prevalent in clinical settings; primarily during rehabilitation from accident or injury, but increasingly as a means to prevent injuries that result from poor technique (e.g., Benjaminse et al., 2015; Crowell, Milner, Hamill, & Davis, 2010). Though we have much to learn about the kinematic and kinetic parameters on which to provide feedback and the most effective ways to present this information, recent research has shown that this type of augmented feedback can allow learners to quickly acquire patterns of coordination that were once considered very difficult, if not impossible, to learn (e.g., Kovacs, Buchanan, & Shea, 2010).\par }

{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-3 A comprehensive series of experiments reported by Swinnen and his colleagues serve as good examples of more recent laboratory research (Beets et al., \line 2012; Swinnen et al., 1990; Swinnen, Walter, Lee, & Serrien, 1993). Participants in these \u173 ?

In several experiments, the kinematic augmented feedback was compared with various other forms of augmented feedback. The results consistently demonstrated the effectiveness of the use of the displacement information.

{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-4 An additional concern about the use of biofeedback as augmented feedback is the tendency for people to become dependent on it to help them perform the skill.

{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2 Finally, three important questions arise about the timing of giving augmented feedback. To continue with the example in which you are teaching a person to play golf, one question is this: Should you give augmented feedback while the person swings, after he or she has hit the ball, or both times?

Terminal augmented feedback can be effective in almost any skill learning situation, although the teacher or therapist must consider the nature of its effect in light of our discussion earlier in this chapter of the four different effects augmented feedback can have on skill learning. Concurrent augmented feedback, as you will see in the following sections of this discussion, seems to be most effective when the task-intrinsic feedback is difficult to use to determine how to perform the skill or improve performance.

{\fs20 Two experiments provide examples of research that has demonstrated this negative learning effect. }{\fs20 In the study by Sigrist et al. (2013) discussed earlier in this chapter, the experimenters compared concurrent augmented feedback with several types of augmented feedback presented terminally to nonrowers learning a simulated rowing task, which was very similar to body-arm rowing taught to beginners in their first rowing lessons and used by experienced rowers as a warm-up exercise. Concurrent augmented feedback was presented auditorily and visually as error information about the oar blade}
{\fs20 \rquote }{\fs20 s deviation from the desired movement. This feedback was provided on each trial while the performer was rowing. Similar information was provided terminally at the end of each practice trial for three training sessions with one session on each of three days. A retention test, with no augmented feedback, was given on days four and eleven. Results showed that while the concurrent feedback produced the best performance during the training sessions, the terminal feedback produced the best performance on the retention test.}

{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw2 The negative learning effect has also been demonstrated for the learning of a discrete task. Vander Linden, Cauraugh, and Greene (1993) compared concurrent and terminal augmented feedback for learning a 5 sec isometric elbow-extension force production task, which is illustrated in figure 15.6. Participants received augmented feedback by seeing the force produced during the performance of the task on each trial. One group received this feedback concurrently. Two other groups received this feedback after they completed performing the task. One of these two \line groups saw this information after every trial; the other saw it after every other trial. During the practice trials, the concurrent augmented feedback group performed the task better than the two terminal groups. However, 48 hr later on a retention test with no augmented feedback, the concurrent group\rquote s performance declined to a level that was the poorest of the three groups.\par }

{\fs20 The second general effect is that concurrent augmented feedback }{\*\cs55\fs20\b0\i enhances skill learning.}{\fs20  A variety of situations have produced this effect. Some of these are the training of flight skills for airplane \u173 ?

Two related hypotheses have been pro}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw1 posed to help us better understand how to predict when concurrent augmented feedback will have a positive or negative effect on learning. First, Annett (1959, 1969, 1970) stated that augmented feedback should be considered in terms of its \u173 ?
information value, which he related to the \ldblquote informa\u173 ?tiveness\rdblquote  of the task-intrinsic feedback and the augmented feedback. When the information value of task-intrinsic feedback is low, but the information value of the augmented feedback is high, }
{\f7\fs20\b0\i0\expnd0\expndtw1 a dependency on the augmented feedback is likely to develop}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw1 .\par }\pard\plain \s15\f7\fs20\ltrpar\qj\fi240\li0\ri0\sb0\sa0\tx240\facenter\sl240\slmult0\expnd0\expndtw0\cf1\up0\charscalex100\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\accnone\hyphpar1\lang1033
{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2 Lintern and his colleagues (Lintern, 1991; \u173 ?Lintern, Roscoe, }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2 & Sivier, 1990) added another dimension to Annett\rquote s hypothesis by proposing that practicing with augmented feedback will benefit learning to the extent that the feedback sensitizes the learner to properties or relationships in the \u173 ?
task\u8239 ?that\u8239 ?specify how the system being learned can be \u173 ?controlled. This means that }{\*\cs55\fs20\b0\i\expnd0\expndtw-1
for concurrent \u173 ?augmented feedback to be effective, it must facilitate the learning of the critical characteristics or relationships in the task as specified by the task-intrinsic feedback.}
{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2  Negative learning effects will \u173 ?result when the augmented feedback distracts attention away from these features. But positive learning effects will result when the augmented feedback \u173 ?
directs \u173 ?attention to these features.\par }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw2 An}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw2  experiment by Buchanan and Wang (2012) shows that very subtle variations in the way that concurrent augmented feedback is provided can dramatically reduce the likelihood that learners will become dependent on the feedback. Participants were required to learn a complex pattern of coordination between the two hands with the aid of a visual display that provided a Lissajous template of the required pattern and a cursor representing the relative position of the two hands. One group (Behind) practiced the task with the cursor superimposed on the template and the other group (Side) practiced}
{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw2  the task}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw2  with the cursor presented in a separate window adjacent to the template. In two experiments, both groups acquired the new pattern of coordination quickly during a }
{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw2 5 min}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw2  practice session. However, on a retention test given 15 minutes later, the Behind group showed a dramatic drop in performance when the visual feedback was removed, whereas the Side group was able to maintain their level of performance in the absence of augmented feedback. These results show that the strong guidance-like properties of concurrent visual feedback can be exploited to facilitate performance and learning if the feedback is displayed in the appropriate manner.}

{\fs20 It is not uncommon to see statements in textbooks indicating that a learner should receive augmented feedback as soon as possible after performing a skill, because delaying it beyond a certain amount of time would lead to poorer learning.

research evidence to support it. Such a view comes from research based predominantly on animal learn\u173 ?ing\u8239 ?(see Adams, 1987). Research has established that humans use augmented feedback as more than a reward: augmented feedback has informational value that humans use to solve problems associated with learning a skill. Whereas animal learning studies have shown that delaying reward leads to decreased learning, human skill learning studies have shown that delaying augmented feedback does not have this negative effect.\par }

{\fs20 The second type of effect is much less common. There is some evidence, although it is sparse, that activity during the KR-delay interval }

The other type of activity that \u173 ?research has shown to hinder skill learning involved estimating the movement-time error of another person\rquote s movement, which the second person performed during the interval.

{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw2 \u8194\'20}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw2 The third type of effect is that certain activities during the }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw2\u173 ?}

estimation of the movement-related characteristics of the perfor\u173 ?mance of the skill. Swinnen (1990), in the \u173 ?experiment described above, compared the strategies of the participant estimating his or her own \u173 ?

{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw2 More recently, Sherwood (2008) further established the learning benefit of the subjective performance error strategy in an experiment involving four different laboratory learning tasks, in which participants estimated their own error on each trial prior to receiving KR. \par }

{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2 The second type of beneficial subjective performance estimation involves the estimation of specific characteristics of some of the movement-related components of an action. In an experiment by Liu and Wrisberg (1997) participants practiced throwing a ball at a target as accurately as possible with the nonpreferred arm and without vision of the \u173 ?
target. Participants received KR by seeing where on the target the ball had landed on each trial. During the KR-delay interval, some of the participants rated on 5-point scales the appropriateness of the force, angle of ball release, and ball trajectory of the throw, and then estimated the throw\rquote s point value on the target. The results indicated that these participants performed more accurately on a retention test than those who had not used the estimation strategy.\par }
{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2 We find an interesting parallel to the subjective performance evaluation strategy in what researchers call the }
{\*\cs55\fs20\b0\i\expnd0\expndtw-2 trials-delay procedure.}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2  Here, learners receive KR for a trial after they complete performance on a later trial. Anderson, Magill, and Sekiya (1994) provided evidence for the effectiveness of this procedure. Participants practiced making a blindfolded aiming movement. One group received KR about distance error after every trial (delay-0). \line A second group received KR two trials later (delay-2), \line which meant that they were told their error for trial 1 after completing trial 3.

Much of this planning seems to require cognitive activity; we see this in the experiments showing that engaging in attention-demanding cognitive problem-solving activity during this interval hinders learning.}

{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw2 The challenge for those interested in developing motor learning theory is to establish why giving augmented feedback less than 100 percent of the time during practice is better for skill learning.

{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2 A more likely possibility is that giving augmented feedback on every trial leads to engaging the learner in a fundamentally different type of learning processing than he or she would experience if it were not given on every trial. Schmidt and his colleagues (e.g., Salmoni, Schmidt, & Walter, 1984; Winstein & Schmidt, 1990) proposed this view, which they called the }
{\f6\fs20\b\i0\expnd0\expndtw-2 guidance hypothesis. }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2 According to this hypothesis, if the learner receives augmented feedback on every trial (i.e., at 100 percent frequency), then it will effectively \ldblquote guide\rdblquote  the learner to perform the movement correctly. However, there is a negative aspect to this guidance process. By using augmented feedback as the guidance source, the learner }
{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2\u173 ?}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2 develops a dependency on the availability of augmented feedback so that when he or she must perform the skill without it, performance suffers. In effect, augmented feedback becomes a crutch for the learner that is essential for performing the skill.\par }
{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2 The hypothesis further proposes that receiving augmented feedback less frequently during practice encourages the learner to engage in more beneficial learning strategies during practice. For example, active cognitive and movement problem-solving activities increase during trials with no augmented feedback and learners are more likely to process task-intrinsic sources of feedback (Anderson, Magill, Sekiya, & Ryan, 2005). The learner does not become dependent on the availability of augmented feedback and therefore can perform the skill well, even in its absence. }

Goodwin and \u173 ?
Meeuwsen (1995) compared 0 percent and 10 percent error bandwidth conditions with those that were systematically expanded (0-5-10-15-20 \u173 ?
percent) and contracted }{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-4 \line }{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-4 (20-15-10-5-0 percent) for learning to putt a golf ball a criterion distance. The two conditions that resulted in the best retention test performance showed interesting KR frequencies. The frequencies for the 10 percent bandwidth condition reduced from 62 percent during the first twenty trials, to between 47 percent and 50 percent on the remaining trials. For the expanding bandwidth \u173 ?
condition, KR frequencies began at }{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-4 \line }{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-4 99 }{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-4 percent}
{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-4  for the first twenty trials when the bandwidth was 0 percent, but then eventually reduced to }{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-4
\line }{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-4 19 percent by the end of the practice trials, as the bandwidths increased in size. Lai and Shea (1999) reported similar findings for the learning of a complex spatial-temporal movement pattern. These results indicate that for the performance-based bandwidth technique it is the reduction of KR frequency during practice that is important to improved learning.\par }
{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw2 From an instructional perspective, the bandwidth technique provides a useful means of }{\*\cs55\fs20\b0\i\expnd0\expndtw2
individualizing the systematic reduction of the frequency of augmented feedback}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw2  in practice situations.

{\fs20 supporting the benefit of the summary technique for motor skill learning (e.g., Guay, Salmoni, & Lajoie, 1999;}{\fs20  }{\fs20

{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw2 \line }{\fs20 Willoughby, 1990). However, a very practical }{\fs20\u173 ?}{\fs20 question remains to be answered: What is the optimal number of performance attempts, or practice trials, to include in a summary augmented feedback statement? Although there have been several attempts to determine whether a specific number of trials is optimal, the results have been equivocal. Two answers appear reasonable at the present time on the basis of results of research that has investigated }
{\fs20 \line }{\fs20 this question.}{\fs20 \par }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1 First, Sidaway, Moore, and Schoenfelder-Zohdi (1991) concluded that the positive effects of the summary technique are not due to the number of trials summarized, and stated that their results argue against the notion of an \ldblquote optimal summary length.\rdblquote  Instead, they argued that the summary effect is related either to the reduced frequency of presenting augmented feedback or to the trials delay involved in presenting augmented feedback using the summary technique (note that the summary technique has characteristics similar to the trials-delay procedure, which we discussed earlier in this chapter).\par }
{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2 An alternative answer is one we have seen related to many of the issues discussed in this book. The \ldblquote optimal}
{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2 \rdblquote  summary length may be specific to the skill being learned. Guadagnoli, Dornier, and Tandy (1996) provided evidence for this possibility by showing that longer summaries are better for the learning of simple skills, whereas shorter summaries lead to better learning of more complex skills.\par }
{\fs20 One of the possible strategies people may use when presented with a listing of augmented feedback is to }{\*\cs55\fs20\b0\i
estimate an average for the series of trials}{\fs20  that the summary includes. The research literature provides some evidence that this may occur. In experiments in which the learner receives the average score for all the trials in a series, the \u173 ?
results have shown that this procedure leads to \u173 ?better learning than presenting augmented feedback after every trial (Young & Schmidt, 1992), and no better or worse than after every trial or after every third trial (Wulf }
{\fs20 & Schmidt, 1996). But when compared to the summary technique, no differences are found in terms of their influence on skill learning (Guay, Salmoni, & Lajoie, 1999; Weeks & Sherwood, 1994; Yao, Fischman, & Wang, 1994).\par Finally, }
{\*\cs55\fs20\b0\i\expnd0\expndtw0 why are these two feedback presentation methods effective?}{\fs20  Their effectiveness is undoubtedly due to the same factors that lead to the benefit of reducing augmented feedback frequency, as explained by the guidance hypothesis. During practice trials on which they receive no augmented feedback, people engage in beneficial learning \u173 ?
activities that are not characteristic of people who receive augmented feedback after every trial.}{\fs20 \par }\pard\plain \s17\f6\fs18\ltrpar\ql\fi0\li120\ri0\sb0\sa250\facenter\sl220\slmult0\expnd0\expndtw0\cf0\up0\charscalex100\caps\b\i0\ul0\strike0\accnone\hyphpar0\lang1033

{\fs18 Visual augmented feedback has also been shown to have motivational benefits for learning motor skills. An interesting example comes from its use in a physical therapy context.

{\*\cs56\f10\fs18\b0\i0 \'9f}{\fs18 nenburger, 2008). \par An important implication of these findings is that the practitioner can present augmented feedback in a way that influences a person\rquote s feelings of success or failure which, in turn, influence a person to continue or to stop his or her involvement in participating in a physical activity.\par }

{\fs18\expnd0\expndtw-1 A study by Hebert, Landin, and Menickelli (1998) investigated the use of video replays as a part of the practice sessions for skilled female tennis players who needed to improve their attacking shots.

\u8194\'20Following a pretest, the patient engaged in three balance training therapy \u173 ?sessions a week for four weeks. During each therapy session the patient stood on two force plates while looking at a computer monitor placed at eye level. On the monitor, he could see a small white dot superimposed on a white cross, which indicated an appropriate center of gravity while standing. During each therapy session, a clear plastic template marked with a circular pattern of eight alphabetic letters was placed on the monitor. A verbal command to the patient indicated that he should initiate a weight shift that would cause the white dot to move from the center and hit the target letter and then return the dot back to the center cross. The patient did this for six 1 min intervals with a 45 sec rest between intervals. A posttest followed at the end of the 4 wk training period, and a retention test was given two weeks later.\par }
