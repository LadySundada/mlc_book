{\fs18\expnd0\expndtw-2 A primary reason a person practices a skill is to increase his or her capability of performing it in future situations that will require the skill.

A student in a physical education class who will receive a grade based on performance on skills tests wants to practice those skills in ways that will lead to a high level of performance on the tests. Dancers need to perform in recitals, \u173 ?
performances, and competitions. Athletic trainers practice taping an ankle or knee so they can do it \u173 ?effectively and quickly with athletes when needed. And physical rehab patients practice skills so that they can perform them as needed in their everyday environment. Because of this future performance \u173 ?
requirement, teachers, coaches, athletic trainers, and therapists must design and establish practice conditions that will lead to the greatest probability of successful performance in situations that will require the practiced skills.\par }

{\fs18\expnd-1\expndtw-5 Consider two more specific examples. Suppose you were taking golf lessons, and your instructor told you to go to the practice range and hit a basket of practice balls. You know you need practice hitting your long irons. What would be the best way for you to spend your practice time using your long irons so that you can improve your performance with those irons when you play a round of golf on the golf course?

One practice characteristic that increases the chances for future performance success is the variability of the learner\rquote s experiences while he or she practices. This includes variations of the characteristics of the context in which the learner performs the skill, as well as variations of the skill he or she is practicing. The practitioner must address several important questions to determine how to optimize the types and amount of variation to include in practice experiences. First, what aspects of performing the skill should he or she vary? Second, how much variety of experiences is optimal? Third, how should the variety of experiences be organized in the practice sessions? We consider these questions in the discussion that follows.\par }

{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-3 An important benefit a learner derives from practice experiences that promote movement and context variability is an increased capability to perform the skill in a future test situation. This means that the person has acquired an increased capability not only to perform the practiced skill itself, but also to \u173 ?
perform the skill in novel conditions that might characterize the test situation, such as in a competitive event. When viewed from the perspective of transfer of learning, where the transfer of interest is from practice to the test, the inclusion of movement and context variability in practice can be seen as a means of enhancing positive transfer from the practice to the test contexts.\par }

{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2 In two experiments, Shea and Kohl (1990, 1991) had participants learn to apply 175N of force while pressing a handle. One experimental group, the constant practice group, practiced only this skill for 289 trials, while a variable practice group practiced producing four different amounts of force (125N, 150N, 200N, and 225N). Notice that none of the amounts of force practiced by the variable practice group was the 175N goal. When both groups performed a retention/transfer test for the 175N goal (the test was a retention test for the constant group but a transfer test for the variable group), the variable group performed more accurately than the constant group.\par }
{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-5 Variable practice was also shown to result in better learning than constant practice in an experiment involving a sports skill (Shoenfelt, Snyder, Maue, \u173 ?
McDowell, & Woolard, 2002). In this study, participants practiced shooting basketball free throws. The results, which can be seen in figure 16.1, showed that the constant practice group, which practiced only from the free-throw line, improved during the three weeks of practice, but two weeks later on a retention test, returned to their pretest level of perfor\u173 ?

Those in the trial-and-error group were told the goal movement time and received knowledge of results (KR) about their timing error after each trial. The results indicated that the two groups performed similarly on the retention test, but the trial-and-error group performed more accurately on a transfer test when both groups had to move in a different amount of time, which was 1,800 msec.\par }

Participants in the study learned a keypress sequencing task under conditions that varied the amount of information about which key to press next in the sequence and therefore encouraged different amounts of error. The primary finding was that retention of the sequences was better when more errors were made during practice. However, not all types of errors had the same beneficial effect on learning. The benefits came from errors that gave learners an opportunity to fully engage in the error detection and correction processes that enabled them to evaluate their decision making strategies. In contrast, errors that were induced by making decisions difficult to evaluate during practice did not have the same facilitatory effect on learning.}

{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-3 An important instruction planning decision is determining how to provide practice variability during practice sessions for learning a skill.

{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-5 Because we know that experiencing practice variability benefits skill learning, it is important that we next consider how to organize the variable experiences within a practice session or unit of instruction. For example, suppose you are an elementary school physical education teacher organizing a teaching unit on throwing for your classes. You have determined that you will devote six class periods to this unit. You want the \u173 ?
students to learn three variations of the throwing pattern: the overhand, underhand, and sidearm throws. The practice organization question for this situation is this: How should you arrange these three different throws for practice during the six class periods? Figure 16.2 shows three possible arrangements. One is to practice each throw in blocks of two days each (blocked practice). Another possibility is to practice each throw in a random arrangement with 5 min blocks devoted to each particular pattern (random practice). Thus, each day students would experience six 5 min blocks, with no specified order of occurrence for the three patterns; the only stipulation would be that they practice all three an equal amount over the course of the unit. The third arrangement, serial practice, also involves a 5 min block for each pattern. However, in this \u173 ?
approach students practice each pattern for two sets of 5 min every day in the same order.}{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-5 \par }\pard\plain \s14\f6\fs20\ltrpar\qj\fi240\li0\ri0\sb0\sa0\tx240\facenter\sl240\slmult0\expnd0\expndtw0\cf1\up0\charscalex100\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\accnone\hyphpar1\lang1033
{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-3 This organization question is not unique to physical education. It applies to any situation in which learners must practice and learn several variations of a skill. Consider a few examples. In a therapy \u173 ?
situation, a patient may need to practice grasping objects of different sizes, weights, and shapes. A patient who has had a knee joint replacement may need to practice walking on different types of \u173 ?

Batters hit fastballs, curves, or change-ups according to a blocked or random schedule. In the blocked schedule, players practiced hitting one of these pitches on each day, whereas in the random schedule, they hit all three types of pitch, randomly presented, each day. The results showed that on a test involving a random sequence of pitches, like one that would occur in a game, players who had experienced the random practice schedule performed better than those who had practiced according to the blocked schedule.\par In addition to these few examples, several other studies have found evidence that demonstrates the contextual interference effect for the learning of real-world skills. These include basketball shooting skills, tennis groundstrokes, volleyball serves, rifle shooting, knot tying, handwriting skills, chiropractic spine manipulation, and computer game skills (see Brady, 1998; Enebo & Sherwood, 2005; Ollis, Button, & Fairweather 2005; Ste-Marie, Clark, Findlay, }

{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2 Another possible reason for the limited generalization of the effect was presented by Brady (1998). In}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2
 his assessment of the research that investigated }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2 the contextual interference effect}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2
, Brady concluded that research involving laboratory tasks tends to support the hypothesis (e.g., Wood }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2 & Ging, 1991; Wulf & Lee, 1993). But when research involves applied settings, higher amounts of contextual interference tend to enhance the learning of skill variations that are more similar than different (also see Barreiros, Figueiredo, & Godinho, 2007}
{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2 ,}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2  and Merbah & Meulemans, 2011). For example, compared to a low contextual interference practice schedule, moderate and high contextual interference practice schedules produced better learning of one-hand basketball set shots from different distances and angles (Landin & Hebert, 1997), but not better learning of three different volleyball skills (French, Rink, & Werner, 1990).\par }
{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-4 Two reasons may account for this discrepancy between the laboratory and applied settings. First, the learning of sport skills requires more practice than has been included in those studies that have not found the effect. Because sport skills tend to be more complex and difficult than the typical laboratory skills used in contextual interference research, much more practice would be required to learn the sport skills. The second reason is that sport skills may have unique characteristics that may require a practice schedule that increases contextual interference, such as a progression of low to high amounts of contextual interference (see Porter, 2008; Porter & Magill, 2010). Unfortunately, these two possibilities remain speculative until we have a sufficient amount of research evidence that either supports or does not support them. However it is noteworthy that Saemi and colleagues (2012) reported a learning benefit for elementary school children in physical education classes who experienced a progressive low-to-high contextual interference practice schedule.}

{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1 The following example illustrates how these different practice schedules would require different types of action plan activity.

repeat only the answer.

{\fs20 Lee and Magill hypothesized that the high contextual interference practice condition is like the addition situation in which there are several other problems to solve before you see the first problem again. When a learner practices a motor skill, the interference created by the practice trials between two trials of the same skill variation causes the person to forget much of the action plan he or she \u173 ?
developed for the first trial. As a result, the learner must reconstruct and modify that plan to attempt the skill on the next trial.

{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2 The }{\*\cs64\fs20\b\i0\expnd0\expndtw-2 specificity of practice hypothesis}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2  is one of\u8239 ?
the oldest principles of human learning. Its origins can be traced back to the early 1900s when Thorndike (1914; Thorndike & Woodworth, 1901) presented the }
{\*\cs62\fs20\b0\i\expnd0\expndtw-2 identical elements theory}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2  to explain why positive transfer occurs between two skills or skill learning situations. Briefly, this theory, which was discussed in chapter 13, proposed that the more \ldblquote elements\rdblquote  (i.e., physical and mental \u173 ?
characteristics) }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2 two skills or situations have in common, the greater the amount of transfer of learning or performance. The practice specificity hypothesis can also be linked to our discussion in chapter 3 about motor abilities where we considered the specificity of motor abilities hypothesis, which was attributed to Franklin Henry in the 1960s (e.g., Henry, 1961a, 1961b). Henry\rquote s hypothesis proposed that motor abilities are independent and task specific and that individuals have varying levels of many motor abilities. In addition, the relationship between perfor\u173 ?
mances by a person on two different skills would depend on the degree of common abilities between the skills. Finally, in chapter 12 in the discussion of various performer and performance characteristics that change during the course of learning a skill, you read about the influence of practice specificity in skill learning for a performer-related characteristic that does not change.\par }
{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-3 Researchers generally agree that sufficient research evidence exists to support the practice specificity hypothesis for at least three characteristics of motor skill learning and performance. We have discussed each of these in previous chapters, but we will consider them here as they apply to the organization of practice.

researchers showed support for Proteau\rquote s hypothesis for the learning of a variety of motor skills, such as manual aiming, power lifting, and walking. }
{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-4 In addition to those studies, a more recent one by Moradi, Movahedi, and Salehi (2014) found similar vision effects for learning a basketball free-throw shooting skill. \par An especially notable finding in some of those studies is that as the amount of practice with vision increases, the\u8239 ?
need for vision on a subsequent retention or transfer test also increases (Proteau, Tremblay, & DeJaeger, 1998). Evidence has indicated that this increased need for vision during }
{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-4 retention and transfer}{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-4  is not because the availability of vision during practice prevented the processing of proprioceptive information, but because practice with vision }
{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-4 encourages}{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-4  people to prefer to use the same motor plan to perform the skill without vision \line (on transfer tests) as they used during practice with vision (Mackrous & Proteau, 2007).\par }
{\fs20 A different approach to the practice specificity effect of vision during learning involved the use of observational learning (Osman, Bird, & Heyes, 2005). The experiment involved participants learning an eight-item sequence in a serial reaction time task on a computer keyboard.

{\fs20 \par }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw1 Neurophysiological evidence also demonstrates the practice specificity effect for sensory characteristics.

Eventually the metronome stopped but the participants continued to tap the rhythm. The brain areas active during practice with the visual metronome remained active during the tapping without the visual metronome. These brain areas were those in the visual dorsal stream, which we discussed in chapter 6 as the vision-for-action visual system.}

{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-3 You read in chapter 10 that the encoding specificity principle is a well-established characteristic of \u173 ?
memory. This principle identifies the strong association between encoding and retrieval contexts for memory performance by stating that the more a memory test (i.e., retrieval) context resembles the practice (i.e., encoding) context, the better will be the retention performance.

{\*\cs62\fs20\b0\i\expnd-1\expndtw-3 incidental}{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-3  remembering refers to the remembering of related but nonessential parts of the context. For example, you are practicing the \u173 ?

this example, reporting the ball speed represents intentional remembering; reporting the ball\rquote s landing location represents incidental remembering.\par }

{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-3 Research by David Wright and his colleagues extended the performance context aspect of the encoding specificity principle to motor skill learning \line situations. Their research consistently }

skill to be learned }{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-3 also}{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-3  get learned (e.g., Wright & Shea, 1991, 1994). In these experiments participants typically learned three- or four-digit sequences of key presses on a computer keyboard. Participants saw specific \u173 ?
sequences of the numeral keys displayed on the computer monitor as the intentional items they needed to learn. In addition, each sequence was color coded, which created an association between a number sequence and its color. }
{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-3 Participants}{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-3  were not told about the color-}{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-3\u173 ?}{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-3
coding feature, }{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-3 which means that }{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-3 color was an incidental part of the performance context; it was not a part of }
{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-3 the skill that the participants were told to}{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-3  learn. However, }{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-3
their performance was better on the transfer test when they were shown both the number sequence (the intentional items to be learned) together with the associated color coding (the incidental part of the practice environment) than when they were shown the same number sequences with different colors.}
{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-3  Thus they learned not only the number sequences that they were told to learn, but also the colors associated with the sequences. Interestingly, in interviews after the experiment, participants indicated that they were unaware of the number-color relationship.\par }
{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-4 What is evident from the research investigat\u173 ?ing performance contexts is that people }{\*\cs62\fs20\b0\i\expnd-1\expndtw-4
learn more about the context than they are explicitly instructed to learn}{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-4 . Parts of the environmental context in which a skill is practiced get included in what \u173 ?
people learn. When these incidental parts of the context are available during a test, they serve as cues, or aids, to help retrieve the memory representation of the learned skill. Conversely, when these incidental environmental context features are not available during the test environment, performance is diminished. Examples of this effect include the use of mirrors in dance studios and weight training rooms. Because the mirrors are part of the practice environment, the visual feedback received from them becomes part of what is learned. When the mirrors are not available, as would occur in a dance performance on a stage or in a weight lifting competition, performance of these activities would be poorer than it would be with the mirrors present. \par }
{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-5 According to Shea and Wright (1995), the decision of which specific skill to perform in a situation and the speed of its selection depend on the strength of the relationship between intentional and incidental features in the perfor\u173 ?
mance environment. The implication for skill training is to include as many features of a test environmental context as possible in the practice environmental context. For example, if a goal of gait training in physical therapy is for the patient to be able to walk in a crowded mall as part of his or her daily living activities, then therapy sessions should include supervised walking in a crowded mall when the therapist determines that the patient can engage in this type of activity. In terms of its application to sports situations, the learning of the incidental parts of players\rquote  environmental context during practice and competitions leads to the \ldblquote home field advantage\rdblquote  that is commonly observed in sports competitions. This means that parts of the performance context in the \ldblquote home field\rdblquote  are more familiar to the home team because they learned those parts when they practiced in that context. Thus, they have learned important context cues that aid their performance, even though they never practiced intentionally learning those cues.}

{\fs20 In chapter 13, one of the explanations of positive transfer considered the similarity of the cognitive \line processes required by the skills or learning situations. According to the }
{\*\cs62\fs20\b0\i transfer-appropriate processing theory}{\fs20 , the type of practice that is best when a person is learning a skill requires the same type of cognitive processing activity that will be required in a transfer test, regardless of the physical similarity between the practice and test skills and situations.

decision making. }{\fs20 A good example of this type of rapid decision-making situation is when a soccer player dribbles the ball down the field and sees that a defender will soon confront him or her, the player must decide very quickly whether to continue dribbling, or to pass the ball to a teammate. }
{\fs20 One of the reasons for this relationship is that the cognitive processing that }{\fs20 is a part of}{\fs20  practice becomes a part of what is learned. As a \u173 ?

{\fs20 An experiment by Pellecchia (2005) provides a good example of the practice specificity of cognitive demands during skill learning.

Two groups of participants practiced only the balance skill (single-task training) or that skill together with a cognitive secondary task (dual-task training), which was counting backward by threes from a three-digit number that was randomly presented on each trial.

:}{\fs18 \u8194\'20The brain activity results support the practice specificity hypothesis proposed by Proteau (e.g., Proteau, 1992) that motor skill learning is specific to the sources of sensory/perceptual information available during practice.
