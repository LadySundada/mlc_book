{\fs18\expnd0\expndtw-1 When you are reading at your desk and want to write a few notes about what you are reading, you must \u173 ?
undertake a sequence of coordinated movements to accomplish your goal. You must first pick up your pen and then position your head, body, arm, hand, and fingers so that you can use the pen. Then you must initiate the movements required to write the words you want to put on the paper. Although this example may seem to describe a relatively simple task that you can do very easily and quickly, have you ever thought about what is happening in your nervous system to \u173 ?
allow you to carry out this sequence of events? As simple as the \u173 ?individual movements may be, a rather complex array of neural activity is associated with planning and performing the task. For example, your decision to pick up the pen was a cognitive activity, but what happened in the nervous system to change this cognitive act into a motor act? To answer this question, we need to consider two important issues in the study of motor control. One concerns the neuro\u173 ?
physiologic basis of the neural activity associated with this sequence of events. The other is the more theoretical issue of how the cognitive intention to perform an action becomes a sequence of movements that enables a person to achieve the intended action goal. We will consider the first of these issues in this chapter by looking at the central nervous system in terms of its structure and function as related to the performance of motor skills. We will briefly consider the second issue from a neurological perspective but then address it in more detail in chapter 5, where we discuss theories of motor control.\par }

& Glimcher, 1999, for an example of research showing parietal cortex involvement in this type of choice situation). Because of the activity that occurs in the association areas of the cortex, some neuroscientists consider these areas as the location for the transition between perception and the resulting action.\par }
{\fs20 Four cortex areas are especially involved in the control of movement (figure 4.4}{\fs20  shows these and other areas related to the control of movement as well as specific sensory functions). One area, the }
{\*\cs57\fs20\b\i0\expnd1\expndtw4 primary motor cortex}{\fs20\expnd1\expndtw4 , which is located in the }{\fs20 frontal lobe just anterior to the central sulcus, contains motor neurons that send axons to specific skel-\line etal muscles throughout the body. This area of the brain is especially critical for movement initiation and the coordination of movements for fine motor skills, such as the finger movements required to type on a keyboard or play a piano. The motor cortex is also involved in the control and learning of }
{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2 postural coordination (see }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2 Chiou et al., 2018; }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2 Ioffe, Ustinova, Chernikova, & Kulikov, 2006; Petersen, Rosenberg, Petersen, & Nielsen, 2009). The second area, anterior to the primary }
{\fs20 motor cortex, is the }{\*\cs57\fs20\b\i0\expnd0\expndtw-1 premotor area}{\fs20 , which controls the organization of movements before they are initiated and rhythmic coordination \line during movement, thus enabling the }
{\fs20 transitioning}{\fs20  between movements for a skill that involves sequen\line tial movement, such as keyboard typing }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1
or piano playing. Research has also shown the importance of the premotor cortex in the performance benefit derived from the observation of actions performed by another person (Buccino et al., 2001}
{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1 ; Holmes & Wright, 2017}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1 ). In addition, the premotor cortex has been shown to play a key role in the planning of eye movements and orienting visual-spatial attention (Casarotti, Lisi, Umilt}
{\*\cs59\f8\fs20\b0\i0\expnd0\expndtw-1 \'88}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1 , & Zorzi, 2012). Third, the }{\*\cs57\fs20\b\i0\expnd0\expndtw-2
supple\u173 ?mentary motor area (SMA)}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2 ,}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1  which is located on the medial surface of the frontal lobe adjacent to portions of the primary motor cortex, plays an essential role in the control of sequential movements (see Parsons, Harrington, }
{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1 & Rao, 2005) and in the preparation and \u173 ?orga\u173 ?nization of movement, especially in the anterior portion known as the pre-SMA (see }
{\fs20 \line Cunnington, Windisch\u173 ?berger, & Moser, 2005). More recently, researchers have shown the SMA }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2
to play a role, together with other brain regions, in modifying the continuous, bilateral, multijoint movements associated with variable rate pedaling (Mehta, Verber, Wieser, Schmit, & Schinder-Ivens, 2012). Finally, the }
{\*\cs57\fs20\b\i0\expnd0\expndtw-2 parietal lobe}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2  has been identified in recent years as an important \u173 ?
cor\u173 ?tical area involved in the control of voluntary movement (Fogassi & Luppino, 2005; Gottlieb, 2007). For example, the parietal lobe plays a significant role in the control of visual and auditory selective attention (}

Grafton, 2007; Rice, Tunik, & Grafton, 2006). Based on an impressive amount of research demonstrating its role in the control of perceptual and motor activities such as these, there is general agreement that the parietal lobe is especially important in the integration of movement preparation and execution processes by interacting with the premotor cortex, primary motor cortex, and SMA before and \u173 ?

This comparison functions in a way that signals to the muscles any needed adjustments to movements already in progress, thus assuring achievement of the intended movement\rquote s goal.

This interaction occurs both hierarchically and in parallel, as conceptually illustrated in figure 4.7 and table 4.1. Although the organizational diagram in the figure presents a hierarchical model of structures, many of the functions of the structures described in the table are carried out in parallel, which means they occur at the same time rather than as a sequence of events.

{\fs20 In an essay addressing the issue of the neural correlates of coordinated movement, Carson and Kelso (2004) emphasized the importance of not limiting our understanding of the involvement of brain structures in the control of movement to different types of movements. They argue that we should also understand the interactions between regions of the CNS and the muscles in terms of the cognitive intent of the movement. That is, different CNS patterns of activity can occur when the same movement pattern is used to achieve two different action goals. Their example involves a simple flexion movement of the index finger. The two different action goals are to have the peak amount of flexion coincide with the beat (synchronization) or occur off the beat (syncopation) of an auditory metronome. Carson and Kelso describe research evidence of different neural activity in the cerebral cortex for the synchronization and syncopation tasks. When the participants\rquote  intent was to perform the synchronization task, activation of the contralateral sensorimotor cortex, SMA, and ipsilateral cerebellum occurred. In contrast, when their intent was to perform the syncopation task, additional brain areas activated, including the premotor, prefrontal, and temporal association areas, along with the basal ganglia.}

{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw1 The cerebellum receives sensory neural pathways and is the beginning location for several motor neural pathways. It plays a key role in the execution of smooth and accurate movements; it also functions as a type of movement error detection and correction system; and it is an important site for the control of movement activities requiring eye-hand coordination, movement timing, force control and posture control.}
{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw1 \par }{\fs20 The brainstem, which is connected to the spinal cord, contains three main areas that are significantly involved in motor control: the pons, medulla (also called the medulla oblongata), and reticular formation. Each area functions in specific ways that influence the control of voluntary movement.}
{\fs20 \par }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1 The spinal cord is a complex system that interacts with a variety of systems and is critically involved in motor control processes. It consists primarily of cell bodies and axons of neurons that reside in the spinal cord.\par }
{\fs20 Several sensory neural pathways, called ascending tracts, carry neural signals from the various types of sensory receptors through the spinal cord and brainstem to connect with the sensory areas of the cerebral cortex and cerebellum. The dorsal column and the anterolateral system are\'catwo ascending tracts to the sensory cortex. The spinocerebellar tracts are ascending tracts to the cerebellum.}

The extrapyramidal tracts (also called the brainstem pathways) have their cell bodies in the brainstem with axons descending into the spinal cord.\par }
{\fs20 The motor unit, which is the ultimate end of the transmission of motor neural information, is made up of the alpha motor neuron and all the muscle fibers it innervates. It serves as the functional unit of motor control for the innervation of\u8239 ?
the muscles involved in a movement. The amount of force generated by a muscle is controlled \line by the number of motor units active in the muscle.

{\fs18 A technological advancement called brain-computer interfaces (BCI) has shown exciting potential for helping people whose neurological disorders prevent them from physical movement to regain the capa\u173 ?
bility to move. This computer-based technology takes advantage of the electrical activity in the brain that results from actively imagining the act of moving (recall the discussion in chapter 2 about the use of EEG to record brain electrical activity). As described in a \ldblquote News Focus\rdblquote  article in }
{\f4\fs18\b0\i Science}{\fs18  (Wickelgren, 2003), BCIs read brain waves as a person imagines moving a body part. In some cases, the BCI is part of an EEG skull cap. More recent advances have developed BCIs that can be implanted inside the brain. With training the BCI can provide a means of performing in certain functional activities.*\par }

For example, researchers in Austria (Muller-Putz, Scherer, Pfurtscheller, & Rupp, 2005) reported a case study in which a patient was able to train himself in three days to use an implanted BCI so that his paralyzed hand could \u173 ?
maneuver a prosthesis, grasping a small object and moving it from one place to another and then \u173 ?releasing it. Further evidence showing BCI use for grasping was presented by Pistohl and colleagues in Germany (Pistohl, \line Schulze-Bonhage, Aertsen, Mehring, & Ball, 2012). }
