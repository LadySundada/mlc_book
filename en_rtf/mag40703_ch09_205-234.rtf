{\fs18\expnd-1\expndtw-3 Another aspect of attention occurs when you need to visually select and attend to specific features of the environmental context before actually carrying out an action. For example, when you reach for a cup to drink the coffee in it, you visually note where the cup is and how full it is before you reach to pick it up. When you put your door key into the keyhole, you first look to see exactly where it is. When you need to maneuver around people and objects as you walk along a corridor, you look to see where they are, what direction they are moving in, and how fast they are going.

{\fs18\expnd0\expndtw-2 When the term is used in the context of human performance, }{\*\cs67\fs18\b\i0\expnd0\expndtw-2 attention}
{\fs18\expnd0\expndtw-2  refers to several characteristics associated with perceptual, cognitive, and motor \u173 ?activities that establish limits to our performance of motor skills. A common view of attention is that it relates to consciousness or awareness. When used in this way, attention refers to what we are thinking about (or not thinking about), or what we are aware of (or not aware of), when we perform activities. A related view extends the notion of attention to the amount of \u173 ?

{\fs18\expnd0\expndtw1 For example, detecting performance-related in\u8209 ?\line formation in the environment as we perform a skill can be an attention-demanding activity. We observe and attend to the environment in which we move to detect features that help us determine what skill to perform and how to perform it. Although this observation and detection activity demands our attention, it does not always require that we are consciously aware of what we observe and detect that directs our actions.\par Since the earliest days of investigating human behavior, scholars have had a keen interest in the study of attention.

{\fs18\expnd1\expndtw7 Unfortunately, this late-nineteenth- and early-}{\fs18\expnd0\expndtw-1\u173 ?twentieth-century emphasis on attention soon waned, as those under the influence of behaviorism deemed the study of attention no longer relevant to the understanding of human behavior. A renaissance in attention research occurred, however, when the practical requirements of World War II included the need to understand human performance in a variety of military skills. Researchers were interested in several \u173 ?
attention-related areas, such as the performance of more than one skill at the same time; the selection \line of, and attention to, relevant information from the performance environment; the performance of tasks where people had to make rapid decisions when there were several response choices; and the performance of tasks where people had to maintain \u173 ?
attention over long periods of time. The discussion in this chapter will address two of these issues: the \u173 ?simultaneous performance of multiple activities, and the detection of, and attention to, relevant information in the performance environment.\par }

{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-3 A good example of a\u8239 ?central-resource theory is one proposed by Nobel laureate Daniel Kahneman (1973). Although this theory was originally presented many years ago, it continues to influence our \u173 ?

{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2 Kahneman views attention as }{\*\cs65\fs20\b0\i\expnd0\expndtw-2 cognitive effort,}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2
 which he relates to the mental resources needed to carry out specific activities. The location of the source of these resources is central, which means the CNS; furthermore, there is a limited amount of these resources available for use at any given time. In Kahneman\rquote s model (see figure 9.3), the single source of our mental resources from which we \u173 ?
derive cognitive effort is presented as a \ldblquote central pool}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2 \rdblquote  of resources (i.e., available capacity) that has a }

 }{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-3 is that we allocate attention to ensure that we can complete one activity. It is important to note here that }
{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-3 completing}{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-3  one activity may not always be possible. Kahneman }{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-3

able attention was directed toward other activit}{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-3 i}{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-3 es.\par }{\fs20 A }{\*\cs65\fs20\b0\i
second rule}{\fs20  is that we allocate attentional resources according to our }{\*\cs65\fs20\b0\i\expnd0\expndtw0 enduring dispositions.}
{\fs20  These are the basic rules of \ldblquote involuntary\rdblquote  attention, which concern those things that seem to naturally attract our attention (i.e., distract us). We typically will \ldblquote involuntarily\rdblquote  direct our attention to (or be distracted by) at least }
{\*\cs65\fs20\b0\i\expnd0\expndtw0 two types of characteristics }{\*\cs65\fs20\b0\i\expnd0\expndtw0 \line }{\*\cs65\fs20\b0\i\expnd0\expndtw0
of events}{\fs20  in our environment, even though we may be attending to something else at the time. An example of one of these types of characteristics is that the event is }
{\*\cs65\fs20\b0\i\expnd0\expndtw0 novel}{\fs20  for the situation in which it occurs. These events can be visual or auditory. In terms of novel visual events, think about why fans at a basketball game who sit behind the basket like to stand and wave objects in the air while a player is attempting to shoot free throws. Or, consider why you become distracted while driving your car when a ball rolls onto the street in front of you. That we spontaneously and involuntary \u173 ?
allocate our visual attention to novel events such as these is well supported by research evidence (see Cole, \line Gellatly, & Blurton, 2001; and Pashler }
{\fs20 & Harris, 2001, for excellent reviews of this evidence).\par }{\*\cs65\fs20\b0\i\expnd0\expndtw-2 Unexpected noise}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2
 also presents a novel event that spontaneously and involuntarily attracts our \u173 ?attention. For example, how many times have you directed your attention away from the person teaching your class to one of your classmates when he or she sneezes very loudly or drops a book on\u8239 ?
the floor? Consider a different type of example. Why is a professional golfer who is preparing to putt distracted by a spectator talking, when a basketball player who is preparing to shoot a free throw is not distracted by thousands of spectators yelling and screaming? The most likely reason is that the golfer does not expect to hear someone talking while preparing to putt, but for the basketball player, the noise is a common part of the game. As a result, the noise is novel in one situation but not in the other.\par }
{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-4 The second characteristic of events that will \u173 ?involuntarily direct our attention is the }{\*\cs65\fs20\b0\i\expnd-1\expndtw-4
mea\u173 ?ningful\u173 ?ness}{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-4  of the event to us personally. A classic example of this characteristic is known as the }
{\*\cs65\fs20\b0\i\expnd-1\expndtw-4 cocktail party phenomenon,}{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-4  which was first described in the 1950s (Cherry, 1953). Undoubtedly, you have experienced this phenomenon yourself. Suppose you are at a party in a room filled with people. You are attending to your conversation with another person. Suddenly you hear someone near you mention your name in a conversation that person is having with other people. What do you do? You probably redirect your \u173 ?
attention away from your own conversation to the person who said your name. Why did you do this? The reason relates to the meaningfulness of your name to you. Even though you were attending to your own conversation, this meaningful event caused you to spontaneously shift your attention. In sports, it is not uncommon to hear athletes say that while they are performing, the only person they hear saying something to them is the coach. Why? In this competitive situation, the person\rquote s coach is very meaningful to the athlete.\par }
{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-4 The }{\*\cs65\fs20\b0\i\expnd-1\expndtw-4 third rule}{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-4  governing}{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-4

 This phrase means that a person allocates attention in a situation according to his or her \u173 ?specific intentions.

{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw2 Wickens proposed what has become the most popular of these theories. He stated that resources for processing information are available from three different sources. These are the }
{\*\cs65\fs20\b0\i\expnd0\expndtw2 input and output modalities}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw2  (e.g., vision, limbs, and speech system), the }
{\*\cs65\fs20\b0\i\expnd0\expndtw2 stages of information processing}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw2  (e.g., perception, memory encoding, response output), and the }
{\*\cs65\fs20\b0\i\expnd0\expndtw2 codes of processing information}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw2  (e.g., verbal codes, spatial codes). Our success in performing two or more tasks simultaneously \u173 ?
depends on whether those tasks demand our attention from a common resource or from different \u173 ?resources. When two tasks must be performed \u173 ?
simultaneously and share a common resource, they will be performed less well than when the two tasks compete for different resources.\par }
{\fs20 For example, the multiple-resource view would explain variations in the situation involving driving a car while talking with a passenger in the following way. When there is little traffic, driving does not demand many resources from any of the three \u173 ?
different sources. But when traffic gets heavy, \u173 ?resource demand increases from these two sources: input-output modalities and stages of information processing. These are the same two sources involved in providing attentional resources for carrying on a conversation with a friend. As a result, to maintain safe driving, the person must reduce the resource demand of the conversation activity.\par }
{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1 An advantage of multiple-resource theories is their focus on the types of demands placed on various information-processing and response outcome structures, rather than on a nonspecific resource capacity. The resource-specific attention view provides }
{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1 \line }{\fs20 a practical guide to help us determine when task demands may be too great to be performed simultaneously. For example, if one task requires a hand response and one requires a vocal response, a person should have little difficulty performing them simultaneously, because they do not demand attention from the same resource structure. Conversely, people have difficulty performing two different hand responses simultaneously because they both demand resources from the same structure. }

{\*\cs65\fs20\b0\i\expnd0\expndtw-2 attention switching.}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2  It is an advantage to switch }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2
attentional focus rapidly among environmental and situational pieces of information when we must use a variety of sources of \u173 ?
information for rapid decision making. For example, a football quarterback may look to decide if the primary receiver is open; if not, he must find an alternate receiver. In the meantime, the quarterback must make decisions \u173 ?
related to whether or not he is about to be tackled or kept from delivering a pass. Each of these activities requires attention and must be carried out in the course of a few seconds. To do this, the player must rapidly switch attention between external and internal sources of information.\par }

{\fs20 However, certain kinds of attention switching can be a disadvantage in the performance of some activities.

{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2 If, as we just discussed, it is best for people to narrow their attentional focus while performing certain skills, a relevant question concerns the specific location of the attentional focus.

{\fs20\expnd1\expndtw3 The German scholar Wolfgang Prinz (1997) }{\fs20\expnd1\expndtw6 formalized this view by proposing the }{\*\cs67\fs20\b\i0\expnd0\expndtw-1
action effect hypothesis}{\fs20\expnd1\expndtw4  (Prinz, 1997), which proposes }{\fs20 that actions are best planned and controlled by their intended effects. The theory basis for this hypothesis relates to how we code sensory and motor information in memory. Prinz contends that we represent both in memory in a common code, which argues against the separation of perception and action as unique and distinct events. Without going further into the theory issues involved, the }
{\*\cs65\fs20\b0\i common coding view}{\fs20  predicts that actions will be more effective when they are planned in terms of their intended outcomes rather than in terms of the movement patterns required by the skill.}
{\fs20  \par An interesting application of this hypothesis was reported in an article in }{\*\cs65\fs20\b0\i The New Yorker}{\fs20
 magazine (Acocella, 2003) about the great ballerina Suzanne Farrell. Although retired from performing, she teaches ballet to experienced students and \line professional dancers.

One of the research methods for investigating this hypothesis has been to study the effects of attentional focus on motor skill performance and learning.

{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-3 The reason an external focus of attention results in better skill performance has been the subject of some debate (see Wulf, 2013;}
{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-3  Wulf & Lewthwaite, 2016}{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-3 ; and Wulf & Prinz, 2001, for a discussion of the various issues in this debate). However, the most commonly accepted reason is the }
{\*\cs65\fs20\b0\i\expnd-1\expndtw-4 constrained action hypothesis,}{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-3  which was proposed by Wulf and her colleagues (e.g., McNevin, Shea, \line & Wulf, 2003; Wulf, McNevin, & Shea, 2001). According to this hypothesis an internal focus \ldblquote constrains\rdblquote  the motor system because the performer consciously attempts to control it, which results in a disruption of the automatic motor control processes that should control performance of the skill. But when the performer engages in an external focus of attention, the automatic (i.e., nonconscious) processes control performance. Research support for this view has come from several studies that involved a variety of techniques, including dual-task probe reaction times and EMG assessment (see Wulf, 2013; Zachry, Wulf, Mercer, & Bezodis, 2005; and Gray, 2011, for brief reviews of these studies).\par }
{\fs20 It is important to note that other researchers have a slightly different explanation for why focusing externally leads to better performance. For example, Beilock and colleagues (e.g., Beilock, Bertenthal, McCoy, & Carr, 2004; Beilock, Carr, MacMahon, & Starkes, 2002) distinguish bet}
{\fs20\u173 ?}{\fs20 ween }{\*\cs65\fs20\b0\i\expnd0\expndtw0 skill-focused }{\fs20 attention, which is directed to }{\fs20 \line }
{\fs20 any aspect of the movement, and }{\*\cs65\fs20\b0\i\expnd0\expndtw0 environmental-focused }{\fs20 attention, which is directed away from the execution of the skill (and not necessarily on anything relevant to the skill itself). In contrast to Wulf and colleagues, Beilock argues that the appropriate focus of attention is determined by the performer\rquote s skill level. Because beginners tend to consciously control many of the details associated with performance, she believes that a skill-focused attention is appropriate early in learning. On the other hand, because highly skilled individuals have proceduralized most aspects of performance and execute skills automatically with little conscious attentional monitoring, she believes that an environmental focus of attention is better in the later stages of learning. \par }
{\fs20 Like Wulf and colleagues, Beilock proposes that skilled individuals suffer when they focus on controlling the skill because of interference with automatic control processes. Performance deteriorates because the skilled individual reverts to an earlier, less automatic form of movement control. The interference that results from consciously monitoring proceduralized aspects of performance has been referred to as the }
{\*\cs65\fs20\b0\i deautomatization-of-skills}{\fs20  hypothesis (Ford, Hodges, & Williams, 2005). It is also thought to be the basis for what is commonly referred to as }
{\*\cs65\fs20\b0\i choking}{\fs20  under pressure (Beilock, 2010; Beilock & Carr, 2001). Evidence to support the idea that novices perform better under skill-focused instructions and experts perform better when distracted from focusing on the skill itself has been provided for the skills of golf putting (Beilock et al., 2004) and soccer dribbling (Beilock et al., 2002; Ford et al., 2005). In summary, researchers agree that focusing attention on movements leads to poor performance of well-learned skills because attention to movement details interferes with automatic control processes. However, researchers disagree about whether beginners should focus their attention externally or on aspects of the movement.\par }

With respect to automaticity and attention, Kahneman }
{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1 \line }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1 proposes two systems that operate differently but interactively, to help us solve problems, of which we have included performing a motor skill. }

{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1 s}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1 ystem operates when we detect that one object is more distant from us than another, or when we drive a car on an empty road. }

From this perspective, automaticity relates to attention as it allows us to perform certain activities without effortful mental activity, especially when we engage System 1. This system enables us to solve certain problems (mental, perceptual, and motor) by relying on intuition that has developed through learning, which typically results from experience and practice. But, some problems require more effort to solve; they require effortful mental activities }

{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-4 Logan (1985, 1988; Logan, Taylor, & Etherton, 1999), who has produced some of the most important research and thinking about the concept of automaticity and motor skill performance, views automaticity as an acquired skill that should be viewed as a continuum of varying degrees of automaticity.

As a result, the degree of automaticity for a skill or information-processing activity may be only partially automatic when the attention demand of the activity is assessed.\par }
{\fs20 According to both Kahneman\rquote s and Logan\rquote s perspectives, a complex motor skill could involve activities that require a range of attention demands. For example, the movement component of passing a soccer ball may require no attention capacity because }

{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-4 The neural components associated with automaticity as it relates to motor skill performance have also been investigated.

{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-4 Researchers have disputed since the end of the nineteenth century about whether visual selective attention is active or passive (sometimes phrased as \ldblquote top-down or bottom-up,\rdblquote  or \ldblquote goal directed or stimulus driven\rdblquote ). In terms of the information-\u173 ?
processing model in }{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-4 figure 9.1, the basis for this dispute concerns how we select information from the environmental context to process in the first stage. Do we visually select relevant environmental cues according to our action intentions and goals, or do we visually attend to environmental cues because of their distinctiveness or meaningfulness in the \u173 ?
situation? In their review of the visual attention research literature, Egeth and Yantis (1997) concluded that these two types of visual attention control \ldblquote almost invariably interact\rdblquote  (p. 270). This means that in most performance situations, our intentions and goals as well as certain characteristics in the environment influence our visual attention. In other words, although we may actively seek environmental cues based on our action intentions and goals, we may also attend to certain cues because of their distinct characteristics. You will see evidence of this active-passive visual attention throughout this discussion.\par }
{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-4 The term }{\*\cs67\fs20\b\i0\expnd-1\expndtw-4 visual search}{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-4  is used to describe the process of directing visual attention to locate relevant environmental cues.

In the following \u173 ?sections, we consider the actual process of selecting appropriate information from the environment, and give examples from various sport and everyday skills to illustrate how visual search is an important component of the performance of both open and closed motor skills.\par }

{\fs20 As you read in chapter 6, eye movement recordings track the location of central \u173 ?vision while people observe a scene. However, an important question arises concerning how well this procedure assesses visual selective attention. The rationale for the use of the procedure is that what a person is looking at (i.e., the point of gaze) should give researchers insight into what information in the environment the person is attending to. But there is an important research question here: Is this a valid assumption? Can we validly relate eye movements to visual attention?\par }

{\fs20 Two characteristics of the use of eye movement \line recordings provide an answer. First, research evidence has shown consistently that }
{\*\cs65\fs20\b0\i\expnd0\expndtw0 it is possible to give attention to a feature in the environment without moving the eyes to focus on that feature}
{\fs20  (see Henderson, 1996; Zelinsky et al., 1997; and Brisson & Jolicoeur, 2007, for \u173 ?reviews of this evidence). This would mean that \u173 ?
peripheral vision was the source of picking up the relevant information. However, it is }{\*\cs65\fs20\b0\i\expnd0\expndtw0 not}
{\fs20  possible to make an eye movement without a corresponding shift in attention. Second, because eye movement recordings are limited to the assessment of central vision, they do not assess peripheral vision. Research evidence has shown that peripheral vision is involved in visual attention in motor skill perfor\u173 ?
mance (see Bard, Fleury, & Goulet, 1994 for a brief review of this research). As a result of these two factors, }{\fs20 \line }{\fs20
eye movement recordings cannot provide a complete picture of the environmental features to which the person is directing visual attention. Therefore, eye movement recordings typically }
{\*\cs65\fs20\b0\i\expnd0\expndtw0 underestimate}{\fs20  what a person is visually attending to. However, even with these limitations, the recording of eye movements is a useful technique to provide reasonable estimates of those features in the environment that a person directs visual attention to as he or she prepares and performs a motor skill.}

{\fs20 \u8194\'20}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw0 The visual search for regulatory conditions in the performance environment is an active search that a person engages in according to the action he or she intends to perform. This means that the performer looks for specific cues in the performance environment that will enable him or her to achieve a specific action goal. For example, if a person intends to pick up a cup to drink from it, he or she will visually search for features of the cup and \u173 ?

{\fs20 Research evidence also supports the view that we actively visually search the performance environment according to action intentions. For example, Bekkering and Neggers (2002) demonstrated that the focus of initial eye movements differed when participants in their experiment were told to point to or grasp an object. The intention to grasp an object directed participants\rquote  visual search to the spatial orientation of an object, whereas the intention to point to the object did not. The authors concluded that a specific action intention enhances the visual detection of those regulatory conditions that are relevant to the intended action.\par }

{\fs20 It is also important to note that visual search does not always mean that a person performing a motor skill is actively seeking cues in the environment to respond to.

(e.g., Treisman, 1988; Treisman & Gelade, 1980; see }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw0 also Chan & Hayward, 2009).

{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw0 \ldblquote maps\rdblquote  related to the various values of various features.

As a result the batter visually attends to the ball\rquote s rotation because of its salience as a visual cue about the type of pitch.

We described one of these invariant features in chapter 7 when we discussed the importance of the use of time-to-contact information to catch a ball, contact or avoid an object while walking or running, and strike a moving ball.\par }
{\fs20 Abernethy indicated that another essential source of information to detect is the kinematics of an opponent}{\fs20 \rquote s action, which specify what he or she is going to do next. This information is contained in the grouping of joint displacements that define an opponent\rquote s pattern of coordination. As a person becomes more skillful, his or her visual attention becomes increasingly more attuned to detecting the important kinematic features, which provides the skilled player an advantage over the less-skilled player in anticipating the opponent\rquote s action in a situation. In effect then, this minimal essential information \ldblquote pops out\rdblquote  for the skilled player and directs the player\rquote s visual attention as he or she prepares an appropriate action to respond to his or her opponent\rquote s action.\par In addition to detecting essential information \line from an individual player, skilled athletes in dynamic team sports, such as basketall and soccer, \line visually select patterns of play, similar to what chess masters do while playing chess. For example, in a series of experiments by Williams, Hodges, North, and Barton (2006), skilled soccer players were quicker and more accurate than less-skilled players in recognizing familiar and unfamiliar game action sequences presented on film, as point-light displays, and with event and people occluded conditions on film.}

\u8194\'20To determine whether to shoot, pass, or dribble in soccer, the player must use visual search that is different from that involved in the \u173 ?
situations described above. The soccer situation involves many players in the visual scene that must be searched for relevant cues. An experiment by Helsen and Pauwels (1990) provides a good demonstration of visual search patterns used by experienced and inexperienced male players to determine these actions. Participants acted as ball handlers as they viewed slides of typical attacking situations. For each, the person indicated as quickly as possible whether he would shoot at the goal, dribble around the goalkeeper or opponent, or pass to a teammate. The experts took less time to make the decision. Eye movement recordings showed that the experts gained this time advantage because they fixated on fewer features of the scene and spent less time at each fixation.\par }

Results based on subjects\rquote  eye-\u173 ?movement characteristics while watching an actual soccer game showed that the experienced players fixated more on the positions and movements of other players, in addition to the ball and the ball handler.

\u8194\'20Driving a car is a nonsport perfor\u173 ?mance situation in which vision provides information to select and constrain action.

On the freeway, the novices made pursuit eye\u8239 ?movements, whereas the experienced drivers made specific eye fixations that jumped from location to location. That is, the experienced drivers knew which cues were important and specifically searched for those cues. The experienced drivers looked into the rear- and side-view mirrors more frequently than the novices, whereas the novices looked at the speedometer more than the experienced drivers did.\par }

{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1 In an extension of these findings}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1 , Chapman and Underwood (1998) monitored eye movements of novice and experienced drivers as they watched various driving-related scenes that included at least one dangerous situation. In these situations, both types of drivers narrowed their visual search and increased the durations of their eye movement fixations. But the more experienced drivers tended to fixate for shorter amounts of time on specific parts of the scene than the novice drivers. This result indicates that more experienced drivers require less time to detect and process the information obtained from a fixation, which gives them an advantage in determining the appropriate driving action to take in the situation. In addition, the experienced drivers tended to be less variable in where they fixated their eye movements while watching the driving scenes, which, in agreement with the findings of Mourant and Rockwell (1972), indicates their greater knowledge of which environmental cues to look at to \u173 ?
obtain the most relevant information. The results of these two studies have been replicated in several other studies (see Falkmer & Gregerson, 2005}

{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2 According to research by Cutting, Vishton, and Braren (1995), the most important cues involved in avoiding collision in these situations come from the relative location or motion of objects around the object the person needs to avoid. When visually fixating on the object he or she needs to avoid, the person uses relative-displacement and/or velocity information about both the object to be avoided and other objects in front of or behind the object. It is important to note that this decision making is done automatically by the visual system and provides the basis for appropriate action by the motor control system. The key practical point here is that the person needs to visually fixate on the object or objects that he or she wishes to avoid. (See }

{\fs18\expnd0\expndtw-2 A widely held view of the relationship between arousal and performance is that it takes the form of an inverted U. This means that when we graph this relationship, placing on the vertical axis the performance level ranging from poor to high, and placing on the horizontal axis the arousal level ranging from very low to very high, the plot of the relationship resembles an inverted U. This type of relationship indicates that arousal levels that are either too low or too high will result in poor perfor\u173 ?
mance. However, between these extremes is a range of arousal levels that should yield high performance levels. This relationship is often referred to as the Yerkes-Dodson law, which is named after two Harvard researchers who initially described this relationship in 1908 by investigating the relationship between stress and learning (Yerkes & Dodson, 1908; see also Brothen, 2012). Although the original research involved rats, many subsequent studies established its relevance to humans. It is now widely accepted as a common characteristic of human behavior.\par }

{\fs18\expnd-1\expndtw-4 Comparisons of conversations on cell phones and conversations with car passengers have consistently found that cell phone conversations are related to more driving errors than are passenger conversations. For example, in a comparison of driving performance while conversing on a cell phone, conversing with a passenger, and having no conversation, researchers at the University of Utah found that when drivers engaged in cell phone conversations, they increased their driving errors (Drews, Pasupathi, & Strayer, 2008). The conversation characteristics were distinctly different, which the researchers contended influenced the results. The primary difference was that passenger conversations would change as traffic situations changed, which led to a shared awareness of traffic characteristics. Cell phone conversations did not reflect this shared awareness. More recently, Strayer and colleagues (Strayer et al., 2015) have shown that using a speech-to-text system to receive and send texts and emails is even more distracting than conversing on a cell phone.}
{\fs18\expnd-1\expndtw-4  }{\fs18\expnd-1\expndtw-4 It is notable that a review of more than 60 research studies by Lipovac et al. (2017) found agreement with the conclusion that the use of both hand-held and hands-free mobile phones typically results in driving performance decrements. }

{\fs18 Open skills involve moving objects that must be visually tracked, which makes the visual search process different from that used for closed skills. The final gaze fixation (i.e., the \ldblquote quiet eye\rdblquote ) during the perfor\u8209 ?
\line mance of open skills is on the moving object, which the eye then tracks for as long as possible before initiating the required movement.
