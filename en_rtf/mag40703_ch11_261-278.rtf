 the performance of a skill is. We never really perform a skill when everything in the }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw0 performance context is exactly the same each time. Something is different every time we perform a skill. The difference may be our own emotional state, the characteristics of the skill itself, an environmental difference such as a change in weather conditions, the place where we perform the skill, and so on. Thus, successful skill performance requires adaptability to changes in personal, task, and/or environmental characteristics. The degree of adaptability required depends on the skill and the performance situation. As a person progresses in learning a skill, his or her capability to perform the skill successfully in these changed circumstances also increases. Later in this book, we will explore some instruction and practice condition characteristics that can influence how well a person adapts to these various situations.\par }

{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-5 Each curve in figure 11.2 shows better perfor\u173 ?mance as the curve slopes upward. However, as we noted earlier, there are instances in which the slope of the curve is in a downward direction to indicate performance improvement.

{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-4 . However, there are various statistical procedures that can be used for curve smoothing when the reporting of research results warrants it.

{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-4 To assess improvement and consistency in performance for a series of practice trials, researchers commonly show one performance curve graph for each trial or a group (i.e., block) of trials.

{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2 You can see an example of this approach to kinematic measures in figure 11.3}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2 . The task required participants to move a lever on a tabletop to produce the criterion movement displacement pattern shown at the top of this figure. Each \u173 ?
participant observed the criterion pattern on a computer monitor before attempting to produce it by moving the lever. The four graphs located below the criterion pattern show one person\rquote s performance for 800 trials. The graphs show the practice trials in blocks of ten trials each. To demonstrate performance changes during practice, figure 11.3 shows four of the blocks of trials, each representing a different portion of the 800 trial session. Each graph shows two performance characteristics: the person\rquote s average (mean) pattern drawn for the block of ten trials (the solid line); and the variability (SD, or standard deviation) of the patterns drawn for the same block of trials (dashed lines).}
{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2 \par }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2 To determine }{\*\cs51\fs20\b0\i\expnd0\expndtw-2 improvement in performance,}
{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2  compare the early to the later practice trials by \u173 ?examining how the shape of the person\rquote s produced pattern corresponds to the shape of the \u173 ?
criterion pattern. The graphs in figure 11.3}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2  show that as the person practiced more, the produced pattern became more like the criterion pattern. In fact, in trials 751 through 760, the participant was making a pattern almost identical to the criterion pattern.\par }
{\fs20\expnd1\expndtw3 To assess }{\*\cs51\fs20\b0\i changes in consistency,}{\fs20\expnd1\expndtw3  compare how far the standard deviation lines are from the mean pattern for each block of trials.

{\fs20 The typical way to administer a retention test in a motor skill learning situation is to have people perform the skill they have been practicing after a period of time during which they have not actually practiced the skill.

The actual length of time between the end of practice and the test is arbitrary.

{\fs20 For example, a person who is learning handwriting experiences an initial state represented by the coordination characteristics of the upper arm, forearm, and hand while engaged in handwriting at \line the beginning of practice. These characteristics make up the preferred spatial and temporal structure the person and the task itself impose on the limb, so the limb can produce movement approximating what is required.

{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2 figure 11.4) required participants to learn a new asymmetric \u173 ?bimanual \u173 ?coordination pattern. (We briefly considered in \u173 ?
chapter 7 the motor control difficulties associated with these types of tasks.) To perform the task, they simultaneously moved two levers on a tabletop \u173 ?
toward and away from the body at the same rate (15\u8239 ?times in 15 sec). Their goal was to produce ellipses on the computer monitor. To \u173 ?
accomplish this, they had to coordinate the movement of their arms so that the right arm on each \u173 ?cycle was always 90 \u173 ?
degrees out-of-phase with the left arm. Recall from the discussion of relative phase in chapter 2 that this means that the \u173 ?
position of the right arm\rquote s lever at any point in time had to be 90 degrees different from the position of the left arm\rquote s lever. For example when the left arm\rquote s lever was at 0\'a1, \line the right arm\rquote s lever had to be at 90\'a1. This 90-degree \u173 ?
difference had to be maintained throughout the 15\u8239 ?}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2 sec of movement.\par }{\fs20 The initial coordination pattern for the two arms for one participant is shown in figure 11.4 as the arm-to-arm displacement relationship performed on the pretest.

The consistency of this coordination pattern is indicated by the amount of overlap of the fifteen diagonal lines produced during the pretest.

{\fs20 \par By the end of day 3, this person had learned to produce the ellipse pattern.

However, notice the instability of the performance in the many trials between the old and the new stable patterns (exhibited on the day 1 pretest and the day 3 posttest). This instability occurs during the transition between two stable states and characterizes the process of learning a new skill.\par }

{\fs20\expnd1\expndtw4 You read in chapter 9 that the dual-task procedure is commonly used to assess attention demands of activities or tasks. Because attention demands are important in the learning of motor skills, the dual-task procedure can be a means of determining if changes in attention demands for a skill change as a learner becomes more skillful, which, according to Kahneman\rquote s theory, is predicted as a characteristic of learning. Because of this expected change, we would assume that we could assess changes in attention demands of a skill or task as a means of assessing learning. Research evidence supports this expectation. For example, Gabbett, Wake, and Abernethy (2011) demonstrated that, for a fundamental rugby skill (the draw and pass), attention demands are lower for high-skilled than lesser-skilled players. In the experiment, the researchers engaged players in a standard drill involving the skill. The dual-task procedure required players to verbally respond as quickly as possible to the frequency level of a tone (high, mid, or low) they heard while they performed the draw and pass skill. \par }

Other possible explanations for a performance plateau may be that it represents a period of poor motivation, a time of fatigue, or a lack of attention directed to an important aspect of a skill.

be best as an aid to help people learn a \u173 ?partial-weight-bearing task? This task is a skill \u173 ?often taught by physical therapists. (KR refers to performance-outcome information a person receives from a source external to himself or herself. KR \line will be discussed in detail in chapter 15.)}
{\fs18\expnd0\expndtw-2 \par }{\f6\fs18\b\i0\expnd0\expndtw-2 The task:}{\fs18\expnd0\expndtw-2  The participants\rquote  goal was to learn to support 30 percent of their body weight while stepping on a floor scale with a preferred leg while on crutches. The target amount of weight was marked on the scale for each person. Participants in one group could see the scale needle move as they were stepping on the scale (concurrent KR). These participants were able to correctly adjust their weight on each trial. Two other groups received augmented feedback after performing the task (terminal KR). Participants in these groups could not see the scale needle during each trial, but saw a red line on the scale after completing one trial or a five-trial set (the five-trial group saw five red lines, each marked with the corresponding trial number of the set).}
{\fs18\expnd0\expndtw-2 \par }{\f6\fs18\b\i0\expnd0\expndtw-2 Practice trials and retention test:}{\fs18\expnd0\expndtw-2  All three groups performed eighty practice trials on one day. Two days later, they performed a retention test}
{\*\cs52\fs18\expnd0\expndtw-2\super 2}{\fs18\expnd0\expndtw-2  that consisted of twenty trials without any KR about the amount of weight they applied to the scale.\par }
{\f6\fs18\b\i0 Results:}{\fs18  }{\*\cs51\fs18\b0\i During the practice trials}{\fs18  the concurrent KR group performed with very little error. The two terminal KR groups performed with significantly more error than the concurrent group. However, }
{\*\cs51\fs18\b0\i on the retention test}{\fs18  the concurrent group performed significantly worse than at the end of the practice trials and worse than both of the terminal groups. The terminal feedback groups performed with about the same amount of error as they produced at the end of the practice trials.}
{\fs18 \par }{\f6\fs18\b\i0\expnd-1\expndtw-3 Conclusion:}{\fs18\expnd-1\expndtw-3  It is important to notice that if the \u173 ?
retention test had not been given, the conclusion about the best KR condition for learning this task would have favored the concurrent condition. \line However, this conclusion would be based on performance when the various types of KR were available to the participants. The more valid way to determine which feedback condition is best for learning is when no KR is available, because it reflects the therapy goal of enabling people to perform the \u173 ?
partial-weight-bearing task in daily living conditions, which is with no augmented feedback. When the participants were tested under this condition on the }
{\fs18\expnd-1\expndtw-3 retention test, the conclusion was that the }{\*\cs51\fs18\b0\i\expnd-1\expndtw-3 concurrent KR was the worst learning condition.}
{\fs18\expnd-1\expndtw-3  Thus, performance during practice \u173 ?mis\u173 ?represented the influence of the KR conditions on learning.\par }
