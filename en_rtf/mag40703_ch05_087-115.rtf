{\fs18\expnd0\expndtw2 To successfully perform the wide variety of motor skills we use in everyday life, we must coordinate various muscles and joints to function together. These muscle and joint combinations differ for many skills. Some skills, such as hitting a serve in tennis or getting out of a chair and into a wheelchair, require us to coordinate muscles and joints of the trunk and limbs. Other skills involve coordination of the arms, hands, and fingers; examples are reaching to pick up a pencil, playing the guitar, and typing on a keyboard. Other skills require us to coordinate our two arms or legs in such a way that each one does something \u173 ?
different at the same time, such as when we hold a jar with one hand and screw open the top with the other or kick a ball with one leg while the other is firmly on the ground. For still other skills, where only one arm and hand are involved, we must coordinate only a few muscles and joints. We do this when we manipulate a computer joy stick or a car\rquote s gearshift.\par }

{\fs18 Motor skill performance has other important general characteristics in addition to body and limb coordination. For example, we perform some skills with relatively slow movements; think of how we position a bow before releasing an arrow or pick up a cup to take a drink from it. Other skills, such as throwing a ball or jumping from a bench to the floor, require fast, ballistic movements. Some motor skills, such as writing a numeral or buttoning a shirt, have few component parts; other skills, such as performing a dance routine or playing the piano, have many parts and therefore are very complex.\par }
{\fs18 Also, we can produce remarkably accurate and consistent movement patterns from one performance attempt to another. We are capable of performing well-learned skills with a remarkable degree of success in a variety of situations, even though we have never before been in similar situations. For example, a skilled tennis player will have to use a forehand stroke in many different situations in matches. The many different characteristics in any situation, such as the ball\rquote s flight pattern, speed, spin, bounce, and location on the court, as well as the opponent}
{\fs18 \rquote s position, the wind and sun conditions, and so on, provide little chance that any two situations can be exactly alike. Yet a skilled player can hit the ball successfully.\par These examples of the variety of motor skills we can perform indicate the many different ways we must coordinate various parts of our body in order to achieve the action goals of these skills. }
{\fs18 An active nervous system underlies}{\fs18  this amazing capability we have to perform such a variety of motor skills in so many different situations and contexts}
{\fs18 .}{\fs18  }{\fs18 The question we will address in this chapter is this: }{\fs18 How does the nervous system function to enable us to carry out the movements required for the vast array of action goals we need to achieve on a daily basis? \par }

{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-4 In the behavioral sciences, which include the study of human motor control and learning, theories focus on explaining human behavior. When the human behavior of interest is the performance and learning of motor skills, we look to theories to \u173 ?
provide us with explanations about why people perform skills as they do, which means identifying the variables that account for the performance characteristics we observe.

{\fs20 Because coordination involves head, body, and limb movement patterns, an important question in the study of motor control is this: }
{\*\cs49\fs20\b0\i How does the nervous system control the many muscles and joints involved in producing a complex movement pattern?}
{\fs20  To answer this question, we must consider an important problem that was first posed by \u173 ?Nicolai Bernstein, a noted Russian physiologist whose work, produced from the 1930s to the 1950s, did not become known to the Western world until 1967. }
{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1 His work continues to influence research and theory}{\fs20  related to motor control. Bernstein proposed that to perform a well-coordinated movement, the nervous system had to solve what he termed the \ldblquote degrees of freedom problem.\rdblquote }

{\*\cs50\fs20\b\i0\expnd-1\expndtw-4 degrees of freedom problem}{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-4  arises when a complex system needs to be organized to produce a specific result. The control problem is as follows: }
{\*\cs49\fs20\b0\i\expnd-1\expndtw-4 How can an effective yet efficient control system be designed so that a complex system, having many degrees of freedom, is constrained to act in a particular way?}
{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-4 \par }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2 Consider the following example of the degrees of freedom control problem in a complex mechanical system. A helicopter is designed so that it can fly up or down, to the left or the right, forward or backward, and so on, and at a variety of speeds. If the pilot had to control one switch or lever for each component needed to make the helicopter fly a certain way, the pilot\rquote s job would be overwhelming. Therefore, the helicopter designer reduces the complexity of the task by providing control sticks and pedals that the pilot can manipulate simultaneously with his or her hands and feet.

{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2 When the nervous system must control the human body so that it performs a complex motor skill, such as }
{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2 climbing a ladder}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2 , it faces a degrees of freedom control problem similar to that involving the helicopter. The determination of the actual number of degrees of freedom that must be controlled in \u173 ?
coordinated human movement depends on which level of control we are considering. At one level, we might consider motor units as the elements that must be controlled. At another level, we could consider joints as the element of \u173 ?
interest. Regardless of the control level considered, it becomes evident that for any motor skill, the control problem involved in enabling a person to perform that skill is an enormous one. However, as you will see in chapter 12, when a person practices a skill and progresses from a beginner to a skilled performer, the motor control system solves the degrees of freedom problem in ways that are evident from the changes we can \u173 ?
observe in specific coordination characteristics.\par }\pard\plain \s10\f4\fs21\ltrpar\ql\fi0\li0\ri0\sb360\sa120\facenter\sl240\slmult0\expnd0\expndtw0\cf0\up0\charscalex100\keepn\caps\b\i0\ul0\strike0\accnone\hyphpar0\lang1033

{\fs20 These systems differ in two ways. First, a closed-loop control system involves }{\*\cs50\fs20\b\i0\expnd0\expndtw-1 feedback}
{\fs20 , whereas an open-loop system does not. In human movement, the feedback is }{\*\cs49\fs20\b0\i afferent}{\fs20  information sent by the various sensory receptors to the control center.

In the open-loop system, because feedback is not used in the control of the ongoing movement, the instructions contain all the information necessary for the effectors to carry out the planned movement.

This may be so because feedback is not needed, or because there is not enough time to use feedback to effectively control the movement after it is initiated.\par }
{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw0 In the closed-loop system, the movement instructions are quite different. First, the control center \u173 ?
issues an initial instruction to the effectors that is sufficient only to initiate the movement. The actual execution and completion of the movement depend on feedback information that reaches the control center. The feedback provides information about the status of the movement, which serves to enable the \line control center to do one of several things: allow \line the movement to continue as initially instructed, provide additional instructions to \u173 ?
continue the movement in progress, or correct a movement error. }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw1 It is important to note that one of the drawbacks of the classic diagram of the closed-loop system, as shown in figure 5.3, is that it depicts the movement effectors as the only source for feedback. However, in the actual performance of skills in which the closed-loop control system operates, there are several other sources of sensory feedback, such as the visual and auditory systems. These sources of feedback will be discussed in chapter 6.}

{\fs20 An analogy that can help you understand the distinction between invariant features and parameters of a GMP is the distinction between rhythm and tempo in music and dance. A piece of music has a }
{\*\cs49\fs20\b0\i rhythmic structure}{\fs20  that is specified by the time signature, or meter, which is indicated on the written music score, such as 3/4 or 4/4. The first number (which would be the top number on the music score) indicates the number of beats with equal \u173 ?
proportions of time intervals per measure of music. This number establishes the music\rquote s rhythmic structure. The second, or bottom, number specifies which type of note receives one beat, which in the case of the two examples would be the quarter note\'d1that is, the 1/4 note. For the 3/4 meter there are\u8239 ?}
{\fs20 three beats with equal proportions of time intervals in every measure (i.e., the equivalent of three \line quarter notes in each measure); for the 4/4 there are four beats to every measure. In dance, a waltz, for example, has a 3/4 meter, which means it has three beats to every measure and gives it its familiar 1-2-3 sequence of steps. Note, however, that for the waltz, the three beats are not of equal length; the first is long, the second and third are shorter but equal in time. }
{\*\cs49\fs20\b0\i Tempo}{\fs20  refers to the speed at which the music is performed. The same rhythmic structure can be played slowly or fast. You can try this by clapping your hands with one clap for each beat. Try a consistent series of three claps with equal proportions of time intervals between claps, which establishes the rhythmic structure of your clapping. Then clap the same way but faster. Notice that the rhythmic structure doesn\rquote t change even though you increase the speed of the clapping. In this analogy, rhythm in music is analogous to an \u173 ?

{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2 Figure 5.4 presents an illustration of how to \u173 ?interpret the concept of invariant relative time. Suppose you move the index finger of your hand as quickly as possible to press five keys on a keyboard in sequence. Now, suppose that the four \u173 ?
components of this task (the time intervals between the keys: \line keys 1-2, 2-3, 3-4, 4-5) yield the following movement time (MT) proportions: component 1 takes up \line 30 percent of the total MT (component % = component MT/total MT); component 2, 20 percent; component 3, 40 percent; and component 4, 10 percent. \line If the performance of this skill under typical conditions has an overall duration of 10 sec [represented in part (a) of the figure], then regardless of how much you speed up or slow down this overall duration, the actual amount of movement time for each component changes proportionately. In figure 5.4, \line parts (b) and (c) represent this proportional component change for speeding up the skill [part (b)] and slowing it down [part (c)]. Thus, if you typically perform this skill in 10 sec, then the amount of time you spend performing each component is 3, 2, 4, and \line 1 sec, respectively. If you performed the skill twice as fast, in 5 sec, then each component would change proportionately to be 1.5, 1, 2, and 0.5 sec, respectively. If you slowed down your overall movement time to 15 sec, then each component would change to 4.5, 3, 6, and 1.5 sec, respectively.}
{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2 \par }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1 Although motor program theory proposes that the invariant features of a GMP are rather fixed from one performance of a skill to another, it also\u8239 ?

muscles}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1  used to \u173 ?perform the skill. Skilled performers can easily change these from one performance situation to \u173 ?
another, readily adapting them to the specific \u173 ?requirements of each situation.\par }{\fs20 The following two examples illustrate the relationship between invariant features and parameters. One relates to figure 5.4, which, as just discussed, portrays relative time as an invariant feature. This figure also illustrates the parameter of }
{\*\cs49\fs20\b0\i\expnd0\expndtw0 overall duration.}{\fs20  The normal, faster, and slower speeds in the figure show that a person can change the overall amount of time taken to move without altering the relative time structure of the components of the movement.

{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw0 The second example concerns }{\*\cs49\fs20\b0\i\expnd0\expndtw-1 muscles}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw0  as parameters.

distinct \u173 ?invariant spatial as well as relative time \u173 ?features (see\u8239 ?Wright, 1990 for an excellent review of this \u173 ?

Their hypothesis was that if relative time is invariant for the generalized motor program involved in controlling walking and/or running gait patterns, then the percentages for a specific gait component should remain constant across the different speeds.\par The results were consistent with the hypothesis of relative time invariance (see figure 5.5). As gait sped up or slowed down (at least up to 6 km/hr and beyond 8 km/hr), the percentage of time accounted for by each step cycle component remained essentially the same for different speeds.

{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw2 These spontaneous coordination pattern changes are not limited to laboratory tasks. They also have been found for motor skills involved in sports and daily activities.

Since that experiment, the walk-to-run and, conversely, the run-to-walk gait changes that occur as a function of speed have been demonstrated numerous times and have become the basis for an increasing amount of research (e.g., \u173 ?

{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2 When applied to human movement coordination, the concept of self-organization means that when certain conditions characterize a situation, a specific pattern of limb movement emerges. Thus, rather than being specified by a motor program, the coordinated pattern of movement self-organizes within the framework of the characteristics of \u173 ?
environmental conditions, the task demands, and limb dynamics. For example, in the bimanual finger-movement task performed in the Kelso experiments, the in-phase coordination pattern self-organized as a function of the movement speed (i.e., the control parameter). This same type of self-organization is seen for the walk-to-run, or run-to-walk, gait transitions that \u173 ?

{\fs20\expnd2\expndtw8 An analogy here may help.

{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-5 together cooperatively (i.e., synergistically) to achieve \line }{\fs20 a specific goal. Similarly, coordinative structures are ensembles of muscles and joints that work cooperatively to allow a person to achieve a specific action goal, such as grasping an object. \par }
{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw1 For the motor control system the existence of coordinative structures reduces the degrees of freedom that the system must control. Rather than having to control the many degrees of freedom represented by the many muscles and joints involved in performing an action, the motor control system can control one ensemble of muscles and joints. In this sense, the control system for a specific movement can be less complex than would be suggested by the number of degrees of freedom that need to be controlled. For the reach-and-grasp action the activation of the coordinative structure begins when a person has the intention to reach and grasp a cup and the environmental conditions specify that this action should occur. Then, in accordance with the characteristics of the limb and of the environmental constraints, the coordinative structure self-organizes to carry out the action.\par }
{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2 An important behavioral benefit of coordinative structures is that they allow a person to achieve an action goal even when a muscle or joint that is a part of the structure is not able to function normally. For example, if you have a cast on your leg that keeps your knee from bending, you are able to walk up or down the stairs. This is possible because some of the muscles in the ensemble of muscles and joints (i.e., the coordinative structure) associated with walking up and down the stairs will activate in a way that compensates for the lack of involvement by muscles that can\rquote t normally function because of the cast. Consider this compensatory activity as similar to what occurs in sports teams when one of the players is not able to perform at his or her best, but the team performs well because players \ldblquote step up\rdblquote  and perform at a higher level than they typically perform.\par }

{\fs20 Coordinative structures can be intrinsic or developed through practice. }{\*\cs49\fs20\b0\i Intrinsic coordinative structures}
{\fs20  are involved in actions such as walking, running, and bimanual coordination. When we perform these actions, the muscles and joints of the limbs involved have a natural tendency to demonstrate interlimb coordination patterns that have characterized our performance of them since early in life. For example, when performing a skill involving \u173 ?
bimanual coordination, which requires the simultaneous use of both arms and hands, both infants (see,\u8239 ?for example, Corbetta & Thelen, 1996) and adults (see Kelso, Southard, & Goodman, 1979, for instance) typically demonstrate a similar natural \u173 ?
tendency to move the arms and hands in synchrony\'d1that is, \u173 ?simultaneously both spatially and temporally. This means that when people first learn to perform a tennis serve, which requires each arm to simultaneously move in different ways, their initial tendency is to move their arms in the same way at the same time.}
{\fs20 \par }{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-3 In contrast, }{\*\cs49\fs20\b0\i\expnd-1\expndtw-3 coordinative structures developed through practice}
{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-3  become new combinations of muscles and joints that act together to produce a \u173 ?coordination pattern that will allow the achievement of an action goal. The tennis serve just described is a good example of the development of \u173 ?
a\u8239 ?new coordinative structure as a result of extensive practice. Another example was described by Seifert, \line Chollet, and Allard (2004) for swimmers. As front-crawl swimmers achieved elite status, they began to \line }
{\fs20 demonstrate a stroke speed and length relationship with breathing frequency that allowed them to adapt to race situation demands more successfully than less skilled swimmers. Similar development of coordinative structures was found for skilled drummers as a result of practicing asymmetric bimanual coordination  patterns (Fuji, Kudo, }
{\fs20 Ohtsuki}{\fs20 , & Oda, 2010).\par For the learning of certain skills, the intrinsic coordinative structures can lead to initial perfor-mance difficulties, as in the case of learning a tennis serve. However, after overcoming these initial difficulties, the person}
{\fs20 \rquote s performance of the skill will benefit from the newly developed coordinative structure, because it will allow him or her to achieve an action goal even though some slight perturbation occurs during the action. For example, if a tennis player is serving, and during the serve a gust of wind makes the ball deviate from its intended path, the player can quickly and easily adjust the movements involved in his or her serving action and achieve a successful serve. Similarly, if a person is jogging on a sidewalk and must step over a curb, the jogger can quickly and easily adjust movement characteristics of his or her gait pattern to avoid tripping while maintaining the jogging coordination pattern.\par }

{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2 Wulf and Lewthwaite described \ldblquote enhanced expectancies\rdblquote  as a person\rquote s expectations or expectancies for future performance success in the learning and performance of motor skills. They indicated that the \ldblquote concept of expectancies}
{\fs20 \'ca.\'ca.\'ca. }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2 refer[s] to a range of forward-directed anticipatory or predictive cognitions or beliefs about what is to occur\rdblquote  (p. 1383). They argued that including this concept in the schema and dynamical systems theories would fill a void in these theories by expressing the importance of this concept\rquote s role in the learning and control of motor skills. In the psychological domain, they indicated that expectancies have been discussed as related to the work of Bandura (1977) concerning the concepts of self-efficacy and outcome expectations. More specifically, these concepts relate to influencing motor skill performance through a person\rquote s confidence in being capable of accomplishing a specific performance outcome, which is typically influenced by the person\rquote s own past performance success, or lack thereof.

{\fs20 The concept of \ldblquote autonomy\rdblquote  in human learning and performance refers to a person being able to exercise control over a situation. Wulf and Lewthwaite incorporated this concept into their theory of motor learning by referring to research that has consistently demonstrated that when people have a choice about certain aspects of their practice and/or performance environment, they are more motivated to perform and typically give more effort to their performance in the situation. Some examples include control over certain characteristics of practice conditions, such as when to receive augmented feedback, or whether they can use an assistive device to help perform a balance task. Wulf and Lewthwaite described some possible explanations for the learning benefits of being able to control practice conditions. For example, researchers have demonstrated that this control led to learners being more actively engaged in the learning process, promoted deeper processing of information relevant to achieving task goals, and increased interest in performing the task being practiced. Each of these learning benefits is consistent with both the schema and dynamical systems theories views of motor learning and motor control, although these theories do not explicitly incorporate the \ldblquote autonomy\rdblquote  perspective in their theories.\par }

{\fs20 of this book, we will briefly summarize it here to show its relationship to the OPTIMAL theory. An external focus of attention refers to a person actively monitoring environmental or task-related cues rather than body-related cues while performing a motor skill.

{\fs20 Opinions vary in terms of the resolution of the motor control theory debate. For example, some \u173 ?researchers foresee a compromise between the two theories, which would lead to the development of a hybrid theory that incorporates the strengths of each theory (e.g., see Abernethy & Sparrow, 1992; }
{\fs20 Walter}{\fs20 , 1998). Some research evidence that suggests the \u173 ?potential for some compromise was reported by Amazeen (2002). In a series of experiments, she demonstrated that the application of specific aspects of a dynamical systems theory to the generalized motor program theory could account for performance characteristics associated with the acquisition of rhythmic bimanual coordination skills that the generalized motor program theory alone could not. However, she left open the possibility that her results could be interpreted as support for only the dynamical systems theory.\par Others argue that a hybrid theory is unlikely. For example, Abernethy and Sparrow (1992) speculated \line that a compromise theory would not emerge be-cause the two theories represent two vastly different approaches to explaining the control of coordinated movement. They reasoned that because of this difference, the history of science would predict that one will eventually become the predominant theory. Kelso (1997) expressed a similar view, but was more specific in his projections. He argued that because many aspects of the motor program view can be subsumed within the dynamical systems theory, \u173 ?
especially those related to invariant features and control parameters, and because the dynamical systems theory can explain and predict more of the behavioral features of coordinated movement, the dynamical systems theory will eventually become the predominant theory.

{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1 \par }{\fs20 For a person to learn to produce a well-coordinated movement that achieves an intended action goal, the motor control system must solve the degrees of freedom problem, which concerns constraining \line the many degrees of freedom that characterize muscles, joints, and the like. A theory of motor control should provide an explanation of how the motor control system solves this problem.\par Theories of motor control typically incorporate }
{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1 features of open-loop and closed-loop control systems. Both involve a control center, information}{\fs20
 and effectors. The closed-loop system also includes feedback as part of the system. In an open-loop system, the control center sends the effectors all the movement instructions they need to perform a skill from beginning to end. In contrast, the control center in a closed-loop system sends movement instructions to the effectors that enable them to initiate the performance of a }
{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-3 skill; feedback from the effectors and other }{\fs20 sources provides the control center with the information needed to give the effectors the instructions to continue and end the movement.\par Motor control theories can be distinguished in terms of the relative importance given to the information specified by central \u173 ?
components of the control system or by the environment. \u173 ?Theories that give prominence to information from the control center have in common some form of stored memory representation, such as a motor program, that provides the movement instructions to the effectors. In contrast, theories that give prominence to information specified by the environment emphasize the dynamic interaction of this information with the body, limbs, and \u173 ?
nervous system.}{\fs20 \par }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw2 Schmidt\rquote s schema theory is the most popular \u173 ?representative of motor program\'d0based theories. It proposes that a generalized motor program (GMP) serves as the central, memory-based mechanism for the control of motor skill performance. The GMP is an abstract representation of a class of movements that is stored in memory and retrieved when a skill involving that class of movements is to be performed. Stored in the GMP are invariant features of the movement class, such as the order of movement events and the relative time of the movement components. When a specific action is to be performed, specific parameter values must be added to the GMP; these include the overall duration of the movement and the muscles that will be used.}
{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw2 \par }{\fs20 The dynamical systems theory takes issue with \u173 ?the\u8239 ?importance motor program theories give to memory-based representations for the control of \u173 ?
motor skills. The dynamical systems theory proposes that factors such as environmental invariants and limb dynamics can account for much of the control ascribed to the motor program. The theory views coordinated movement as following rules associated with nonlinear dynamics. The theory incorporates dynamic features such as attractor states, which are preferred, stable patterns that define specific coordination patterns; order parameters, such as relative phase, that functionally define attractor states; and control parameters, such as speed or frequency, that influence the stability and instability of attractor states. Coordinated movement self-organizes as coordinative structures according to the characteristics of the interactions among the person, the environment, and the skill to be performed.\par }
{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw2 At present, there are strong proponents of both the motor program and the dynamical systems theories of motor control. Opinions vary in terms of how the current theory debate will be resolved.\par }

Turvey (1990) put the coordination control problem into perspective this way. If all the joints were only hinge joints like the elbow, there would be one hundred mechanical degrees of freedom to be controlled at the joint level.

{\fs18 types of }{\fs18 joints to carry out a specific act, the degrees of freedom would increase to two hundred.\par }\pard\plain \s33\f5\fs18\ltrpar\qj\fi240\li0\ri0\sb0\sa0\tx240\facenter\sl220\slmult0\expnd0\expndtw0\cf0\up0\charscalex100\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\accnone\hyphpar1\lang1033
{\fs18\expnd0\expndtw2 Consider the following examples.

The total number of joints that need to be controlled for this simple action is 18. Now suppose that the drinking glass in front of you is very large and requires two hands to pick it up. The nervous system must now control at least double the number of degrees of freedom compared to the one-hand situation. In both cases, you probably would not have any difficulty coordinating the joints of one or two limbs to achieve the action goal. But, if we consider these tasks from the level of neuromuscular control where the many degrees of freedom must be controlled to operate in very specific ways, the simple task of picking up a drinking glass becomes a very complex one. Yet, the nervous system handles this complex operation. Theories of motor control need to be able to explain how the nervous system does this.\par }

{\fs18 In an excellent discussion comparing and contrasting the motor programming and dynamical systems views of motor control, Kelso (1997) addressed various issues related to relative time, which is a key variable common to both views. One of the issues that motor \u173 ?
control researchers have struggled with over the years is determining the relationship between brain activity and observable performance characteristics associated with movement. A possible breakthrough in this struggle appears possible through the use of functional brain imaging technology, which enables researchers to observe brain activity while a person engages in performing a motor skill.\par }
