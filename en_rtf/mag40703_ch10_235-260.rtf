{\fs20 Views about the structure of memory have gone through many different phases throughout the history of the study of memory, which can be traced back to the early Greek philosophers. However, one \line characteristic of memory structure that is now commonly accepted is that a part of memory is oriented toward events that have just occurred, while a part is related to events in the past. This is not a new idea. In fact, in 1890, William James wrote of an \ldblquote elementary\rdblquote  or \ldblquote primary\rdblquote  memory that makes us aware of the }
{\fs20 \ldblquote just past.\rdblquote  He distinguished this from a \ldblquote secondary memory\rdblquote  that is for \ldblquote properly recollected objects.\rdblquote  To primary memory, James allocated items that are lost and never brought back into consciousness, whereas to secondary memory, he allocated ideas or data that are never lost. \u173 ?
Although they may be }{\fs20 \ldblquote absent from consciousness,\rdblquote  they are capable of being recalled.\par }\pard\plain \s14\f6\fs20\ltrpar\qj\fi240\li0\ri0\sb0\sa0\tx240\facenter\sl240\slmult0\expnd0\expndtw0\cf1\up0\charscalex100\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\accnone\hyphpar1\lang1033
{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1 The debate about the structure of memory has centered on how this distinction between memory for immediate things and memory for things in a more distant past fits into a structural arrangement. At present, the bulk of the evidence supports the view that there are two components of memory.}
{\*\cs55\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1\super 1}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1  The evidence for this comes from two different but complementary research approaches to the study of human memory. One of these is taken from the study of cognitive psychology, where inferences about the structure and function of memory are based on observing the behavior of individuals in memory situations. The other approach is that of the neuropsychologist or neurophysiologist, who is interested in explaining the structure of memory in terms of what is occurring in the nervous system during behavioral changes related to memory. Research evidence from both of these approaches provides convincing evidence that the memory system comprises at least two components that are definable by their distinct functions. Also, it is important to note that after reviewing and evaluating the relevant \u173 ?
research literature, Healy and McNamara (1996) concluded that although some elaboration of various aspects of the component model of memory \u173 ?
is\u8239 ?needed, the model remains a useful means of \u173 ?understanding human memory.\par }\pard\plain \s15\f5\fs20\ltrpar\ql\fi0\li0\ri0\sb240\sa0\facenter\sl240\slmult0\expnd0\expndtw0\cf1\up0\charscalex100\b\i0\ul0\strike0\accnone\hyphpar0\lang1033

{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-3 Several different models of human memory have been developed to represent its component structure. One of the most enduring and influential was \u173 ?
presented by Atkinson and Shiffrin in 1968. Using a computer analogy, they conjectured that mem\u173 ?ory structure should be thought of as similar to com\u173 ?

{\fs20 Since the time of Atkinson and Shiffrin\rquote s presentation of theory of memory structures, the primary theoretical problem has been to determine the exact nature of these structures. While debate continues about memory structure, there is general agreement that this structure of memory should include different memory storage components in addition to serving a functional role for what the person does with the information in each component. (To read a brief overview of the neuroscience debate about memory structure, see Nee, Berman, Moore, & Jonides, 2008.)}
{\fs20 \par An excellent example of a memory structure model that accommodates these characteristics was proposed by Baddeley (1986, 1995, 2003}
{\fs20 , 2012}{\fs20 ). According to this view, memory is seen as comprising two functional systems, }{\*\cs53\fs20\b0\i\expnd0\expndtw0
working memory}{\fs20  and }{\*\cs53\fs20\b0\i\expnd0\expndtw0 long-term memory}{\fs20  (see figure 10.1). Each memory system is defined in terms of its functions. Although a number of different functions have been proposed, we will focus primarily on three: putting information in memory (referred to as storage processes), getting information out of memory (referred to as retrieval processes), and specific functions in each component.}

{\*\cs53\fs20\b0\i how much}{\fs20  information we can accommodate. The issue of capacity in working memory was originally presented by George Miller in 1956, in an article that has become a classic in the memory literature. Miller provided evidence to indicate that we have the \u173 ?
capacity to hold about }{\*\cs53\fs20\b0\i seven items (plus or minus two items),}{\fs20  such as words or digits, in short-term storage. To increase the \ldblquote size\rdblquote  of an item in memory involves a control process termed }

The newly created larger item, or \ldblquote chunk\rdblquote  as Miller called it, enables people to recall far more than five to nine individual items at a time. However, research has shown that although the size of a chunk may \u173 ?
increase, working memory\rquote s capacity for storing them remains constant at about seven (Cowan, Chen, & Rouder, 2004; Mathy & \u173 ?
Feldman, 2012). Thus in terms of storage capacity, items maintained in working memory can vary in size. One of the problems researchers have experienced in investigating the capacity limit of working memory is determining how to objectively define and measure an \ldblquote item\rdblquote  or chunk.}

{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-4 The definition and measurement problem has been especially problematic for researchers interested in motor skills who are interested in testing Miller\rquote s capacity hypothesis in terms of the remembering of movements. In spite of this problem, a few researchers }

investigations of this issue, Wilberg and Salmela (1973) reported that an eight-movement sequence of arm-positioning movements was the upper limit of working memory capacity for movements. In another study, Ille and Cadopi (1999) asked twelve- and thirteen-year-old female gymnasts to reproduce a sequence of discrete gymnastics movements after watching the sequence one time on a videotape. The gymnasts\rquote  recall performance demonstrated a six-movement capacity limit for the more-skilled gymnasts and a five-movement limit for the less-skilled gymnasts. The results for these young gymnasts are in line with those reported by Starkes, Deakin, Lindley, and Crisp (1987) for young skilled ballet dancers, who showed evidence that an eight-\line movement sequence was their capacity limit.}
{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-4 \par }{\fs20 To account for research evidence that has shown that highly skilled individuals (i.e., experts) seem to have a working memory capacity that is greater than that of the general population, Ericsson and Kintsch (1995) proposed a memory mechanism they called }

{\fs20 One of the few experiments that has directly distinguished these two types of knowledge as they \u173 ?relate to motor skill performance provides an excellent example of the difference between declarative and procedural knowledge. McPherson and \line Thomas (1989) classified nine- to twelve-year-old boys as \ldblquote expert\rdblquote  or \ldblquote novice\rdblquote  tennis players based on length of playing experience and tournament play. Novices had only three to six months playing experience. The \ldblquote experts,}
{\fs20 \rdblquote  who had at least two years of experience and had played in junior tournaments, were in an elite group for their age. The players were interviewed after each point (something that the researchers had previously established did not disrupt the quality of performance). Players were asked to state what they had attempted to do on the previous point. When this information was later compared with what they had actually done (which was analyzed from a videotape recording), some interesting results were obtained. First, in terms of having an effective strategy or action goal, the experts knew what to do nearly all the time, whereas the novices generally never knew what to do. Second, although the experts were quite capable }
{\fs20 \line }{\fs20 of demonstrating that they knew what action goal to establish in a specific situation, they were not always able to accomplish it in their performance of the \u173 ?
action. This suggests that the appropriate goal was \u173 ?established but there were problems in the physical execution of the \u173 ?
intended action.\par }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1 A different approach to demonstrating the distinction between declarative and procedural memory is to show that people with memory impairment due to amnesia can learn to perform a motor skill despite evidence of impaired declarative memory related to the task. An example of this type of experiment was reported by Cavaco, Anderson, Allen, Castro-Caldas, and Damasio (2004); chronic amnesic patients were compared to matching normal participants in learning to perform five tasks that were based on real-world experiences, such as weaving fabric, tracing geometric figures, and pouring water into cylinders. The results showed that the amnesic }
{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1 \line }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1 patients improved performance on all five tasks during practice trials and maintained improved performance levels 24 hours and 2 weeks later. In fact, their performance levels were comparable to the normal control participants. However, when the amnesic patients were given declarative memory tests as part of the 24-hour retention test, they performed much worse than the normal participants and showed no explicit recall of characteristics of any of the five tasks they had practiced.}

{\*\cs53\fs20\b0\i movement recognition test}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2  would involve having a person produce several different movements and then asking which of these is the one just demonstrated or most appropriate for a specific situation.\par In terms of learning and performing motor skills, we are often confronted with both recall and recognition \ldblquote tests,}
{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2 \rdblquote  sometimes in the same situation. For example, if a person must climb a ladder, he or she must }
{\*\cs53\fs20\b0\i\expnd0\expndtw-2 recall}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2  what to do and how it should be done in order to safely and effectively climb the rungs to the desired height. When the person then climbs the ladder, he or she must recognize that the movements performed are the same as those he or she recalled. In a sport context, when a baseball or softball batter must decide whether or not to swing at a pitch, he or she engages in a recognition test when determining if the ball is in the strike zone or not. Then, to produce the appropriate swing, the batter must recall what to do to carry out this action and then be able to recognize if the swing that has been initiated is appropriate for hitting the pitch where it is thrown.\par }
{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw0 An important benefit of recall and recognition tests is that each provides different information about what has been remembered or forgotten.

Although you may not have been able to identify these rules, you confirmed your knowledge of them by the sentence you articulated.

{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2 For motor skills, we can assess implicit memory by asking a person to verbally describe how to perform a skill and then asking him or her to perform it. As is often the case, especially with highly skilled people, the person can successfully perform a skill but cannot verbally describe what he or she did. For example, if you were asked to verbally describe how you tie your shoes without using your hands, you might not be able to do it, or you might experience some difficulty doing it. Does this mean you don}
{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2 \rquote t know how to tie your shoes or that you have forgotten how to tie your shoes? No; in terms of our earlier distinction between procedural and declarative knowledge, it means that you do not have access to, or immediate access to, your declarative knowledge about tying shoes.

You would physically demonstrate tying your shoes, which would indicate that you had the procedural knowledge necessary to perform this skill.\par }
{\fs20 On the other hand, it is possible to know what to do (i.e., have declarative knowledge), but not be able to actually do what you know you should do (i.e., have poor procedural knowledge).

They also gave young male basketball players an explicit paper-and-pencil test and asked them to indicate what they would do in a given basketball game situation. This information indicated declarative knowledge about what to do. An implicit test was also administered by observing what the players actually did in a situation to determine if they had the procedural knowledge necessary to do what they \u173 ?

{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-4 An important point about trace decay is that it can be effectively tested as a cause of forgetting only in working memory. However, for long-term memory, a major problem is the practical impossibility of maintaining a no-interference test situation. For example, if you try to recall how to hit a slice serve in tennis after several years of not having performed it, you will have some initial difficulty remembering how to do it. Although time is a factor, you undoubtedly experienced the potentially interfering influences of the many cognitive and motor activities you have performed since you last performed this type of serve. Hence, we observe the interaction of interference and time in the long-term memory situation. As a result, we know very little about the influence of time on forgetting \u173 ?

{\fs20 The influence of five different retention interval time and activity conditions on recall performance can be seen in figure 10.3}

{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-3 The characteristic of skills that distinguishes these }{\fs20\expnd1\expndtw4 two situations relates to one of the classification }
{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-3 systems discussed in chapter 1. That is, }{\*\cs53\fs20\b0\i con\u173 ?tinuous motor skills}{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-3
 are typically more resistant to long-term forgetting than are discrete skills, especially when the skill involves producing a series of discrete movements in what we referred to as a serial motor skill.\par }
{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2 Several reasons have been suggested to explain why this retention difference occurs. One is the difference in the }
{\*\cs53\fs20\b0\i\expnd0\expndtw-2 size of the verbal component}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2  of the two types of skills.

{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2 ponents. Another reason is that continuous skills are }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2 \line }{\*\cs53\fs20\b0\i\expnd0\expndtw-2
practiced more}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2  than are discrete skills. This is evident if you consider what a \ldblquote trial\rdblquote  is for these two types of skills.

{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2 Investigation of the issue was very popular in the 1970s and focused primarily on the short-term storage in working memory of spatial positioning movements of the arm. The initial research studies found that movement end-point location is remembered better than movement distance (e.g., Diewert, 1975; Hagman, 1978; Laabs, 1973). In other words, they were better at reproducing the final position of the arm than how far the arm had moved. }
{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2 This can be tested by varying the start position of a movement but keeping the end location constant versus varying the start position and the end location but keeping the distance constant.}
{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2  An important finding showed that when movement end-point location \u173 ?information is a relatively reliable recall cue, people will use a \u173 ?
location-type strategy to recall the movement (Diewert & Roy}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2 ,}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2  1978). However, when location information is totally unreliable and only distance \u173 ?
information will aid recall, people will use some nonkinesthetic strategy, such as counting, to help \u173 ?remember the distance of the criterion movement.\par }
{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1 Another characteristic of remembering location information is that an arm}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1  }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1
movement end location is more easily }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1 remembered}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1  when it is within the person\rquote s own body space (e.g., Chieffi, Allport, &}
{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1  }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2 Woodfin, 1999; Larish & Stelmach}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2 ,}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2
 1982). For limb-}{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1 positioning movements, people typically associate the end location of a movement with a body part and use that as a cue to aid their recall performance. Other research, which will be considered later, suggests that people will also spontaneously associate the end location of limb positions with well-known objects, such as a clock face, to aid recall.\par }
{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2 What does all this mean for teaching motor skills? One implication is that if limb positions are important for successful performance of the skill, the instructor can emphasize these positions in ways that will facilitate learning the skill. For example, if you are teaching a beginner a golf swing, the important phases of the swing that he or she should \u173 ?
concentrate on are critical location points in the swing. The keys could be the beginning point of the\u8239 ?backswing or the location point of the top of the backswing. Or if a therapist or athletic trainer is working with a patient who needs to work on \u173 ?
flexing or extending his or her knee, emphasizing the position of the lower leg can help the patient \u173 ?remember where the last movement was or to \u173 ?
establish a goal for \u173 ?future flexion attempts. If a dancer or Pilates student is having difficulty remembering where her arm should be during a particular movement sequence, a body-part cue about the location of the arm can help her remember the position more effectively.\par }
{\fs20 A note of caution is important here. Instructors of motor skills should not direct people to visually look to the location where the limb should move. Research has consistently shown that visually remembered locations for limb movements will be different from those remembered kinesthetically (see Simmering, Peterson, Darling, & Spencer, 2008, for a review of this research). This means that rather than enhancing the remembering of limb movement positions, the addition of visual information negatively influences how the positions are remembered.}

{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1 When people first practice a new skill, it is very likely that the skill will require that they coordinate their body and limbs in a new way. This characteristic makes it also likely that the new coordination pattern of movements will be more abstract than it \u173 ?

increase the meaningfulness of the movements required \u173 ?to\u8239 ?perform the skill. Two strategies are \u173 ?especially \u173 ?
effective: visual imagery and verbal \u173 ?labels.\par }\pard\plain \s14\f6\fs20\ltrpar\qj\fi240\li0\ri0\sb0\sa0\tx240\facenter\sl240\slmult0\expnd0\expndtw0\cf1\up0\charscalex100\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\accnone\hyphpar1\lang1033
{\fs20 The use of }{\*\cs53\fs20\b0\i\expnd0\expndtw0 visual metaphoric imagery}{\fs20  as a memory strategy involves developing in your mind a picture of what a movement is like. As an instructor, it is best to use a metaphor for an image of something that is very familiar to the learner. For example, rather than provide the complex instructions for how to coordinate the arm movements to perform a sidestroke in swimming, the instructor can provide the learners with a useful metaphoric image to use while practicing the stroke. One such image is of themselves picking an apple from a tree with one hand, bringing the apple down, and putting the apple in a basket. }
{\fs20 In a rehabilitation context, physical therapists often teach the squat movement by having the patient visualize themselves sitting down on a toilet seat rather than describing each of the joint motions involved in the movement.}
{\fs20  Also, research by Nordin and Cumming (2005, 2007) has shown the beneficial use of metaphoric imagery by dancers to help them perform and remember how to perform complex dance skills. (The use of imagery as an instructional strategy will be discussed in more detail in chapter 19.)\par }
{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-3 Another effective strategy that increases the meaningfulness of a movement is to attach a meaningful }{\*\cs53\fs20\b0\i\expnd-1\expndtw-3
verbal label}{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-3  to the movement. One of the earliest demonstrations of the beneficial influence of attaching verbal labels to movements was by John Shea (1977), who had participants move a lever to a stop on a semicircular arm-positioning apparatus. When they arrived at the criterion location, those in one group were provided with a number that corresponded to the clockface location of the criterion \u173 ?
location; another group received an irrelevant verbal label such as a nonsensical three-letter syllable; \u173 ?another group received no verbal label about the \u173 ?
criterion location. Results, as seen in figure 10.5}{\fs20\expnd-1\expndtw-3 , indicated that the group given a clockface label showed no increase in error over a 60 sec unfilled retention interval, whereas the other two groups showed a large increase in recall error. In a related experiment, Winther and Thomas (1981) showed that when useful verbal labels are attached to positioning movements, retention performance of young children (age seven) can become equivalent to that of adults.\par }
{\fs20 There are at least four reasons why the use of \u173 ?visual metaphoric imagery and verbal labels aid the learning of complex motor skills. First, they reduce the complexity of the verbal instructions that would be needed to describe all the movements involved in performing the skill and their relationships to each other. }
{\fs20 This, in turn, reduces the demands on working memory.}{\fs20  }{\fs20 Second, they help change an abstract, complex array of movements to a more concrete, meaningful set of movements}
{\fs20  that is easier to remember}{\fs20 . Third, they direct the performer\rquote s attention focus to the outcome of the movements rather than to the movements themselves, which, as we discussed in chapter 9, enhances the performance of skills. And fourth, they speed up the movement planning process by facilitating the retrieval of the appropriate memory representation of the action (Johnson, 1998).}

the test movements had occurred. In fact, some \u173 ?reports show incidental memory test performance to be as good as it was for the intentional situation.\par }

To the beginner, a dance routine is thought of step by step and movement by movement. Beginning gymnasts think of a floor exercise as so many individual stunts. As they practice, their approach to the skills changes. They begin to organize the routines into units or groups of movements. Three or four component parts are now considered as one. The result will be performing the entire routine with the \u173 ?
requisite timing, rhythm, and coordination. With that result, moreover, will be the added effect of \u173 ?developing a more efficient means of storing the complex routine in memory.\par }

{\fs20 Skilled performers organize information to such an extent that it appears they have an increased working memory capacity; this led Ericsson and Kintsch (1995) to propose the long-term working memory described earlier in this discussion. A good example of this type of subjective organization can be seen in the experiment with \ldblquote novice\rdblquote  and \ldblquote expert\rdblquote  eleven-year-old dancers by Starkes et al. (1987)}
{\fs20 , which}{\fs20  was mentioned earlier in the discussion of working memory capacity. When these dancers were presented \u173 ?
sequences of eight elements that were organized as in a ballet routine, the expert dancers recalled the routine almost perfectly, whereas the novices recalled about half of the sequence correctly. However, when the same number of elements was presented in an unstructured sequence, there was no difference between the skilled and novice dancers in terms of the number of elements they correctly recalled. This result indicates that the organizational structure of the sequence of dance movements was an important \u173 ?
factor in the experts}{\fs20 \rquote  recall perfor\u8209 ?\line mance. In an interesting anecdote, the researchers reported observing an adult principal national-level }
{\fs20 \line }{\fs20 ballet dancer being able to perform a sequence of ninety-six steps after having seen the sequence demonstrated one time. Thus, organization was apparently a strategy used to reduce the working memory load of this sequence and to increase the memorability of the sequence.\par }
{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2 Similar organization effects were reported by Millslagle (2002) for experienced basketball players. Both male and female players were shown slides of structured and unstructured plays that could occur in game situations. On a recognition test given after the players viewed the slides, they more accurately \u173 ?
remembered having seen slides that included the structured plays. Interestingly, when results were compared for the players who were guards, forwards, and centers, the guards\rquote  recognition accuracy was higher than it was for the forwards and centers. Because guards have more experience determining and implementing plays than the other two positions, the results of this experiment further emphasize the \u173 ?

{\fs20 An important influence on the retention of motor skills is the relationship between the context of practice and the context at the time of the test. The context of a movement relates to both the environmental conditions in which the movement is performed and characteristics related to the person performing the movement. For example, if a memory experiment is performed in a laboratory, the \u173 ?
environmental context includes such things as the room in which the experiment is done, the experimenter, the time of day, the noise the participant can hear, the lighting, and so on. Personal context involves such things as the mood of the individual, the limb used to make the movement, the sitting or standing position of the subject, and the sensory feedback sources that are available to the subject. As you will see in this section, differences in these conditions during the time the movement to be \u173 ?
remembered or learned is presented or practiced and during the time the movement must be recalled can influence the success of the recall performance.\par }

{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1 An important point to consider regarding the influence of movement context on remembering or learning a motor skill is the relationship between the practice and test contexts.

{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1 The encoding specificity principle was introduced by Tulving and Thomson (1973). According to this principle, the more the test context resembles the practice context, the better the retention performance will be. Evidence that this principle applies to motor skills has come primarily from laboratory-based experiments (e.g., Lee & Hirota, 1980; Magill & Lee, 1987). However, as you will see in more detail in chapter 13 in the discussion of the concept of the transfer of learning, ample evidence exists to have confidence in generalizing this principle to the learning and performance of motor skills.\par }
{\fs20\expnd1\expndtw3 The encoding specificity principle is based }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1 on \u173 ?research findings that indicate that }

{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-1 \par }{\fs20 The practical implications of the encoding specificity principle seem especially relevant to learning closed skills.

players have practice experiences in which these gamelike \u173 ?conditions prevail. This does not say that this is the only way that free throws can be practiced. However, if game performance is the test of interest, it is essential that gamelike practice be provided.\par }
{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw-2 Consider also a physical therapy example where a knee joint replacement patient is working on knee joint flexion and extension. Based on the encoding specificity principle, because test conditions involve active limb movement, practice conditions should emphasize active rather than passive limb movement.
